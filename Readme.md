The Manuscript folder is of most interest, there is a PeerJ subfolder that has the Rmarkdown file (including all the analysis code) for the submitted paper.

The folder DATA has most of the data.
All large data files are not included and are available on request, or can easily be downloaded from the sources mentioned in the paper in the Manuscript folder (as otherwise we would have to pay for GLF storage for this publicly available data).
The processed data folder has some datasets that have been derived


The folder scripts has some older and background scripts that highlight parts of the analysis
