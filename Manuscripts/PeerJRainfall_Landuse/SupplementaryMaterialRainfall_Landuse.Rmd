Cross correlations Rainfall and Climate Indices
===============================================

These figures were moved to the supplementary data in the review process. 

```{r cor-rain-qld, fig.cap="Cross-correlation of six climate indices and rainfall in QLD study region. Bars in the plot indicate the strength of the cross-correlation at different lags. For the PDO analysis, 108-year rainfall data (1900 - 2008) are used. Otherwise, 36-year rainfall data are used. The correlation with NINO 3 is not shown as it is very similar to but weaker than for NINO 3.4.", out.width="90%", echo=F}
include_graphics("figures/FigS1.png")
```

```{r cor-rain-nsw, fig.cap="Cross-correlation of six climate indices and rainfall in NSW/VIC study region. Bars in the plot indicate the strength of the cross-correlation at different lags. For the PDO analysis, 108-year rainfall data (1900 - 2008) are used. Otherwise, 36-year rainfall data are used. The correlation with NINO 3 is not shown as it is very similar to but weaker than for NINO 3.4.", out.width="90%", echo=F}
include_graphics("figures/FigS2.png")
```

Based on the correlation between the climatic indices and rainfall in the regions (as shown in Figure \@ref(fig:cor-rain-qld) and Figure \@ref(fig:cor-rain-nsw)), it can be concluded that:

- In QLD, the correlation between rainfall and SOI at zero time lags is the strongest across all indices, outweighing the other ENSO indicators. IOD and PDO have a weak influence in QLD.  
- In NSW/VIC, again the SOI has the strongest correlation with rainfall, followed by the IOD. For both, the strongest correlations occur at the zero time lags.  
- In both cases PDO had the weakest correlations, and this factor was therefore dropped as a predictor.  
- In general, for the better correlated indices, strongest correlations occured at zero time lags.  

Although some indices are serially correlated with rainfall up to several months, the lag zero events have the greatest correlation coefficients. Furthermore, using multiple climatic index series was generally found most useful in rainfall prediction [e.g. @Risbey2009; @Kamruzzaman2011].

Further figures
===================

These two figures highlight the GAM residual analysis for a sample pixel. Residuals for other pixels were similar across the regions analysed.

```{r residuals, fig.cap ="The residual analysis of the Generalised additive modelling  indicating how well the residuals follow the regression assumptions. Results are shown for a sample pixel in the QLD region (top) and NSW/VIC region (bottom). Residuals are fairly normal as seen from the histogram and the qqplot, but show some scattering in the variance.", echo=F, eval=T, out.width="90%"}

```

This figure indicates a boxplot of the annual rainfall residuals across the regions.

```{r meandiff, fig.cap ="Boxplots of annual rainfall residuals (estimated based on Equation 2 before and after the land cover intervention during 1979 - 2015 in the study regions. On average, the after period has a significantly lower annual rainfall residual in NSW/VIC, but a significantly higher annual rainfall residual in the Qld study area", echo=F, eval=T, out.width="70%"}
