	of such understanding is related to the degree of impact landsliding
	may cause on human settlements and economic activities, and on forest
	ecosystems. In this paper, the distribution of hillslope instability
	in the Sierra Norte, Puebla, Mexico is addressed by means of a diachronic
	analysis, which involves the development of vegetation indexes, as
	well as vegetation fragmentation derived from Landsat-5 (TM) and
	Landsat-7 (ETM+) satellite images from 1989 and 1999, respectively.
	The time period was chosen to compare vegetation cover conditions
	prior and after the extreme October 1999 rainfall event that triggered
	hundreds of slope failures in the study area. Results suggested there
	was a significant vegetation reduction from 1989 to 1999, which was
	strongly expressed by an increase of 809 km(2) of bare surfaces.
	Additionally, areas with highest vegetation density (91-100%) decreased
	considerably, from 1245 to 363 km(2), resulting in a net vegetation
	reduction of 70%. Furthermore, it was possible to highlight that
	landslide concentration was much higher on surfaces that were bare
	and had low vegetation density (0-50%), representing 85% of hillslope
	instability, than on surfaces having a greater density of vegetation
	cover. Land use change and land degradation are precursors to environmental
	hazards, such as mass movement events, that pose serious threats

  abstract = {A land surface model (LSM) has been included in the ECMWF Hamburg
	version 4 (ECHAM4) atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM).
	The LSM is an early version of the Organizing Carbon and Hydrology
	in Dynamic Ecosystems (ORCHIDEE) and it replaces the simple land
	surface scheme previously included in ECHAM4. The purpose of this
	paper is to document how a more exhaustive consideration of the land
	surface-vegetation processes affects the simulated boreal summer
	surface climate. To investigate the impacts on the simulated climate,
	different sets of Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP)-type
	simulations have been performed with ECHAM4 alone and with the AGCM
	coupled with ORCHIDEE. Furthermore, to assess the effects of the
	increase in horizontal resolution the coupling of ECHAM4 with the
	LSM has been implemented at different horizontal resolutions. The
	analysis reveals that the LSM has large effects on the simulated
	boreal summer surface climate of the atmospheric model. Considerable
	impacts are found in the surface energy balance due to changes in
	the surface latent heat fluxes over tropical and midlatitude areas
	covered with vegetation. Rainfall and atmospheric circulation are
	substantially affected by these changes. In particular, increased
	precipitation is found over evergreen and summergreen vegetated areas.
	Because of the socioeconomical relevance, particular attention has
	been devoted to the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) region. The results
	of this study indicate that precipitation over the Indian subcontinent
	is better simulated with the coupled ECHAM4-ORCHIDEE model compared
	to the atmospheric model alone.},

	releases CO2 to the atmosphere, which exerts a warming influence
	on Earth's climate. However, biophysical effects of deforestation,
	which include changes in land surface albedo, evapotranspiration,
	and cloud cover also affect climate. Here we present results from
	several large-scale deforestation experiments performed with a three-dimensional
	coupled global carbon-cycle and climate model. These simulations
	were performed by using a fully three-dimensional model representing
	physical and biogeochemical interactions among land, atmosphere,
	and ocean. We find that global-scale deforestation has a net cooling
	influence on Earth's climate, because the warming carbon-cycle effects
	of deforestation are overwhelmed by the net cooling associated with
	changes in albedo and evapotranspiration. Latitude-specific deforestation
	experiments indicate that afforestation projects in the tropics would
	be clearly beneficial in mitigating global-scale warming, but would
	be counterproductive if implemented at high latitudes and would offer
	only marginal benefits in temperate regions. Although these results
	question the efficacy of mid- and high-latitude afforestation projects
	for climate mitigation, forests remain environmentally valuable resources
	for many reasons unrelated to climate.},

  abstract = {Over the last century there has been marked expansion and infilling
	of pinyon (Pinus spp.)-juniper Juniperus spp.) woodlands into grassland
	and shrubland ecosystems across the western United States. Although
	range expansions in pinyon-juniper populations have been documented
	with changing climate throughout the Holocene, over the last century,
	local scale impacts such as livestock grazing, changes in fire regimes,
	and increasing atmospheric CO(2) concentrations are thought to be
	more recent drivers of pinyon-juniper woodland distribution. Our
	objective was to examine the role of historical livestock grazing
	relative to past climate in regulating pinyon (Pinus edulis Engelm.)
	recruitment and growth over the last Century in a persistent pinyon-juniper
	woodland. We compared pinyon dynamics oil a remote mesa site, minimally
	grazed by domestic livestock, to a nearby historically grazed site
	in southeastern Utah. The presence of a significant number of old
	trees (> 200 yr) at both sites suggests that these populations were
	well established prior to the 20th century. No differences in pinyon
	density or basal area were observed between grazed and ungrazed sites.
	Stand age structure data showed that pinyon recruitment across these
	sites was highly synchronous, with a large recruitment event occurring
	during the early 1900s; 17% of the pinyons oil both sites dated to
	the 1920s. Climatic conditions during this decade were consistently
	cool and wet-conditions known to Support enhanced recruitment and
	growth in pinyon pines. Pinyon growth was also strongly synchronous
	across sites (r = 0.96). Pinyon growth was significantly correlated
	with winter/spring precipitation and negatively correlated with June
	temperature. Taken together, our results Suggest that past climate
	may be more important in structuring pinyon populations than historical
	land use in these persistent pinyon-juniper woodlands. Given future
	climate projections of increasing temperature and more extended drought
	periods, regeneration of pinyon populations following the recent
	regional-scale dieback may be slow. Moreover, prolonged drought combined
	with potentially slow regeneration times for pinyon under future
	climate scenarios Could result in substantial declines in pinyon
	populations across the region, a result that land managers should
	consider when planning for future restoration treatments in persistent
	pinyon-juniper woodlands.},

	the impacts of soybean agriculture on hydrology, a comparison of
	net precipitation (throughfall, stemflow) in undisturbed tropical
	forest and soybean fields on the southern edge of the Amazon Basin
	in the state of Mato Grosso is needed. This study measured throughfall
	with troughs and stemflow with collar collectors during two rainy
	seasons. The results showed that in forest 91.6% of rainfall was
	collected as throughfall and 0.3% as stemflow, while in soybean fields
	with two-month old plants, 46.2% of rainfall was collected as throughfall
	and 9.0% as stemflow. Hence, interception of precipitation in soybean
	fields was far greater than in intact forests. Differences in throughfall,
	stemflow and net precipitation were found to be mainly associated
	with differences in plant structure and stem density in transitional
	forest and soybean cropland. Because rainfall interception in soybean
	fields is higher than previously believed and because both the area
	of cropland and the frequency of crop cycles (double cropping) are
	increasing rapidly, interception needs to be reconsidered in regional
	water balance models when consequences of land cover changes are
	analyzed in the Amazon soybean frontier region. Based on the continued
	expansion of soybean fields across the landscape and the finding
	that net precipitation is lower in soy agriculture, a reduction in
	water availability in the long term can be assumed.},

A gamma distribution function was fitted to the annual rainfall at each station for the two normal periods, and the shape and scale parameters of the distribution, as well as their percentage changes during the last normal period with respect to the first one, were analyzed. The analysis of the annual distribution function parameters reveals some appreciable changes, that are statistically significant, in the spatial rainfall distribution patterns in the southern, northern and central parts of the country. The most striking feature is revealed in the South, where a more than 60 percent increase in the shape parameter occurs, and a similar rate of re-scaling, i.e. a decrease of about 40 percent in the scale parameter. Analysis of the monthly distributions revealed considerable changes in October and November, at the beginning of the rainfall season, and an appreciable change in March, at the end of the rainfall season.},

	programs implemented in China-which have improved the ecological
	environmental conditions-have gained the attention of many researchers
	and highlighted the relationship between forestation and water yields.
	The and and semi-arid Loess Plateau has received attention from water
	engineers and eco-hydrological researchers in China because of a
	shortage in water resources. We selected one of the oldest stations
	conducting soil and water conservation experiments, the Xifeng soil
	and water conservation station, and chose the Nanxiaohe catchment
	and its paired catchments (Yangjiagou catchment and Dongzhuanggou
	catchment) as our research areas. Trends in precipitation, air temperature,
	streamflow over the past 50 years, and the effect of changing land
	use on streamflow were analyzed. The Mann-Kendall test showed that
	precipitation had a negative trend (downward trend), whereas air
	temperature showed a positive trend (upward trend) from the past
	to present in the Nanxiaohe catchment. However, the trends seen in
	precipitation, air temperature did not contain any "jumping points."
	The paired catchment approach is used to detect the effects of land
	cover change on hydrology in the Yangjiagou and the contrast catchment,
	i.e., Dongzhuanggou catchment in our study. The results showed a
	large change in land use in the Yangjiagou catchment from 1954 to
	2008. An increase in forested land (from 0% to 40.08% from 1954 to
	2008) and a reduction of bare land (from 51.26% to 5.50% from 1954
	to 2008) accounted for a large part of the change in land use. However,
	the land use changed little in the contrast catchment. The comparison
	of streamflow in the paired catchments showed that forestation reduced
	streamflow by 49.63% (or 6.5 mm) each year.},

	strong interannual correlation on evaporation. The evaporation is
	related to the moist and shallow planetary boundary layer that provides
	moisture for convection at the cloud base. At global scales, high
	precipitation recycling is also found to be partly correlated to
	warm SSTs in the tropical Pacific Ocean. The Amazon River basin evaporation
	exhibits small interannual variations, so the interannual variations
	of precipitation recycling are related to atmospheric moisture transport
	from the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. Increasing SSTs over the
	50-yr period are causing increased easterly transport across the
	basin. As moisture transport increases, the Amazon precipitation
	recycling decreases (without real-time varying vegetation changes).
	In addition, precipitation recycling from a bulk diagnostic method
	is compared to the passive tracer method used in the analysis. While

	This review focuses on the use of paired catchment studies for determining
	the changes in water yield at various time scales resulting from
	permanent changes in vegetation. The review considers long term annual
	changes, adjustment time scales, the seasonal pattern of flows and
	changes in both annual and seasonal flow duration curves. The paired
	catchment studies reported in the literature have been divided into
	four broad categories: afforestation experiments, deforestation experiments,
	regrowth experiments and forest conversion experiments. Comparisons
	between paired catchment results and a mean annual water balance
	model are presented and show good agreement between the two methodologies.
	The results highlight the potential underestimation of water yield
	changes if regrowth experiments are used to predict the likely impact
	of permanent alterations to a catchment's vegetation. An analysis
	of annual water yield changes from afforestation, deforestation and
	regrowth experiments demonstrates that the time taken to reach a
	new equilibrium under permanent land use change varies considerably.
	Deforestation experiments reach a new equilibrium more quickly than
	afforestation experiments. The review of papers reporting seasonal
	changes in water yield highlights the proportionally larger impact
	on low flows. Flow duration curve comparison provides a potential
	means of gaining a greater understanding of the impact of vegetation

  abstract = {Differing perceptions of the impacts on hydrological functions of
	tropical forest clearance and conversion to other land uses have
	given rise to growing and often heated debate about directions of
	public environmental policy in southeast Asia. In order to help bring
	more balance and clarity to such debate, this paper reviews a wide
	range of available scientific evidence with respect to the influence
	exerted by the presence or absence of a good forest cover on regional
	climate (rainfall), total and seasonal water yield (floods, low flows),
	as well as on different forms of erosion and catchment sediment yield
	under humid tropical conditions in general and in southeast Asia
	in particular. It is concluded that effects of forest disturbance
	and conversion on rainfall will be smaller than the average decrease
	of 8% predicted for a complete conversion to grassland in southeast
	Asia because the radiative properties of secondary regrowth quickly
	resemble those of the original forest again. In addition, under the
	prevailing [`]maritime' climatic conditions, effects of land-cover
	change on climate can be expected to be less pronounced than those
	of changes in sea-surface temperatures. Total annual water yield
	is seen to increase with the percentage of forest biomass removed,
	with maximum gains in water yield upon total clearing. Actual amounts
	differ between sites and years due to differences in rainfall and
	degree of surface disturbance. As long as surface disturbance remains
	limited, the bulk of the annual increase in water yield occurs as
	baseflow (low flows), but often rainfall infiltration opportunities
	are reduced to the extent that groundwater reserves are replenished
	insufficiently during the rainy season, with strong declines in dry
	season flows as a result. Although reforestation and soil conservation
	measures are capable of reducing the enhanced peak flows and stormflows
	associated with soil degradation, no well-documented case exists
	where this has also produced a corresponding increase in low flows.
	To some extent this will reflect the higher water use of the newly
	planted trees but it cannot be ruled out that soil water storage
	opportunities may have declined too much as a result of soil erosion
	during the post-clearing phase for remediation to have a net positive
	effect. A good plant cover is generally capable of preventing surface
	erosion and, in the case of a well-developed tree cover, shallow
	landsliding as well, but more deep-seated (>3Â m) slides are determined
	rather by geological and climatic factors. A survey of over 60 catchment
	sediment yield studies from southeast Asia demonstrates the very
	considerable effects of such common forest disturbances as selective
	logging and clearing for agriculture or plantations, and, above all,
	urbanisation, mining and road construction. The [`]low flow problem'
	is identified as the single most important [`]watershed' issue requiring
	further research, along with the evaluation of the time lag between
	upland soil conservation measures and any resulting changes in sediment
	yield at increasingly large distances downstream. It is recommended
	to conduct such future work within the context of the traditional
	paired catchment approach, complemented with process-based measuring
	and modelling techniques. Finally, more attention should be paid
	to the underlying geological controls of catchment hydrological behaviour
	when analysing the effect of land use change on (low) flows or sediment
	production.},

	formula for the recycling ratio distribution. This formula may be
	applied both for theoretical studies of the influence of regional
	parameters and flow fields on precipitation recycling and for estimating
	the recycling ratio from observational data. To study the effects
	of different flow fields in precipitation recycling a decomposition
	of the two-dimensional flow field into components of pure flow types
	is used. In addition to the exact results, simple analytical formulas
	giving lower bounds of the estimates by the new model are obtained
	for some basic flow fields. The estimates produced by the model are
	compared with those given by existing recycling models, and the range
	of validity of those models is discussed in the context of scale
	dependence of the recycling phenomenon. The results show that, in
	general, the effects of a nonparallel flow field in precipitation
	recycling are significant and may result in more than a twofold increase
	of the recycling ratio. At the same time, the increase in the degree

	Future climate scenarios suggest that the frequency and magnitude
	of precipitation events will change. How much and to what extent
	will these changes impact the hydrological cycle in creosotebush
	(Larrea tridentata) shrublands that dominate the three North American
	hot deserts? In this study, we examine the partitioning of precipitation
	inputs into bare soil evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) within
	creosotebush ecosystems at sites characterized by bimodal precipitation
	regimes: the Santa Rita Experimental Range (SRER) and the Walnut
	Gulch Experimental Watershed (WGEW). At both sites, during summer
	2008, we measured evapotranspiration (ET) using eddy covariance,
	whole plant T using the heat-balance sap flow, and soil moisture
	at several depths. During the dry period preceding the summer monsoon,
	both ET and soil moisture were very low. With the onset of summer
	rains, E dominated ET; shrub transpiration did not respond to increases
	in soil moisture for approximately 3 more weeks. A series of large
	precipitation events increased moisture at deeper soil layers, and
	triggered T. Overall, ET was largely correlated to moisture levels
	in shallow soil layers typical of dryland ecosystems dominated by
	dry conditions, high evaporative demand, and poor soil infiltration.
	Under the current precipitation regime, characterized by many small
	storms and few large storms, soil moisture is low with most precipitation
	inputs lost as E. However, if climatic changes lead to less frequent
	but larger precipitation events, dryland communities could experience
	shifts in the partitioning of ET affecting the hydrologic budget
	of the ecosystem. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  abstract = {A record-breaking heavy rain event occurred over Mumbai, India on
	July 26th, 2005 with 24-h rainfall exceeding 944 mm. Operational
	weather forecast models failed to predict the intensity and amount
	of heavy rainfall. The objective of this study was to test the impact
	of the three different land surface models when coupled to the Weather
	Research Forecasting (WRF), and also to investigate the ability of
	the WRF model to simulate the Mumbai heavy rain event. Numerical
	experiments were designed using the WRF model, with three nested
	domains (30, 10, and 3.3 km grid spacing). Results confirmed that
	the simulated rainfall is sensitive to the grid spacing (with finer
	grids leading to higher rainfall). Results also suggest that simulated
	precipitation amounts are sensitive to the choice of cumulus parameterization
	(with Grell-Devenyi cumulus scheme performing relatively best). To
	reduce the confounding impact of cumulus parameterization in studying
	the impacts of land surface models, we evaluated results for the
	3.3 km grid spacing domain with explicit convection. Simulations
	were performed from 12Z, July 25th to 00Z, July 27th with identical
	boundary conditions and model configurations for three different
	land surface models (the Slab, the Noah, and a modified version with
	photosynthesis module-the Noah-GEM). The model results were compared
	with observed rainfall, surface temperature, and operational soundings
	over three locations: Mumbai, Bangalore and Bhopal. Model results
	showed that: (i) The simulated rainfall was sensitive to the chosen
	land surface model. The rainfall spatial distributions, as well as
	their temporal characteristics, were different for each of the three
	WRF runs with different LSMs. (ii) In contrast to the findings over
	mid-latitudes, the relatively simpler Slab model had a relatively
	better performance than the modestly complex Noah and Noah-GEM LSMs.
	For example, the highest observed rainfall over Mumbai was 944 mm
	and the simulated amounts for Slab, Noah and Noah-GEM runs were 781
	mm, 733 mm and 678 mm, respectively. (iii) Overall, the Slab model
	simulated a relatively cooler surface and a shallower boundary layer.
	Most significantly, the Slab model resulted in a convergence hotspot
	at both the 850 mb and 500 mb levels. which lead to high moisture
	accumulation and higher rainfall activity over Mumbai. Noah and Noah-GEM,
	on the other hand, resulted in a divergence zone over Mumbai and
	the Western Ghats leading to more widespread runs but relatively
	lower rainfall amounts over Mumbai. Additional synthetic experiments
	were performed to test the sensitivity of land use land cover, the
	model start time and run duration. Results indicated that the WRF
	model was able to reproduce several features of the Mumbai rain event,
	and that the land surface representations would have substantial
	impact on the heavy rain simulations. Future studies with more up
	to date land use land cover data, and regional calibration of the
	land surface model parameters, show the potential for improving the
	performance of the Noah-WRF over the Indian monsoon region. (C) 2008

	in Africa, Asia and North America. Each pair consists of a semi-arid
	area lying at the boundary between a major desert and an adjacent
	monsoonal region, and an area of the same size located within the
	monsoonal region itself. The sensitivity of the rainfall to the ground
	hydrology was determined by performing the albedo simulations with
	two different evapotranspiration parameterizations, one giving too
	high evaporation over land and the other giving negligible evaporation
	over land. In the high evaporation case, an albedo change from 0.14
	to 0.35 caused large decreases of rainfall in all three of the semi-arid
	test areas and in two of the three monsoonal test areas. In the negligible
	evaporation case the simulations were performed only for the three
	semi-crid areas; in this case the albedo increase produced a significant
	decrease in rainfall in only one of the areas, the Sahel. Intercomparison
	of the high and negligible evaporation cases shows that changes in
	evaporation rate are as important as changes in albedo. Thus, in
	all but one of the six areas local evaporation was a major factor
	in influencing rainfall.When appreciable evaporation occurs, the
	mechanism by which an increase of albedo reduces the rainfall is
	as follows. Initially, the increase of albedo acts to reduce the
	absorption of solar radiation by the ground and therefore the transfer
	of sensible, plus latent heat into the atmosphere. The resulting
	reduction in convective cloud tends to compensate for the increase
	of albedo by allowing more solar radiation to reach the ground, but
	it reduces the downward flux of longwave radiation even more, so
	that the net absorption of radiation by the ground, solar plus longwave,
	is decreased. Thus, with or without evaporation, the increase of
	albedo causes a net decrease of radiative flux into the ground and
	therefore a net decrease of convective cloud and precipitation.},

	model of flow over the Sahara was constructed. Taking into account
	the biosphere, the feedback mechanism could conceivably lead to instabilities

	cover changes on the regional climate in Amazonia. Four 13-month
	integrations were performed for the following scenarios: (a) no deforestation,
	(b) current conditions, (c) deforestation predicted for 2033, and
	(d) large scale deforestation. All initial and prescribed boundary
	conditions were kept identical for all integrations, except the land
	cover changes. The results show that during the dry season the post-deforestation
	decrease in root depth plays an important role in the energy budget,
	since there is less soil moisture available for evapotranspiration.
	In all scenarios there was a significant increase in the surface
	temperature, from 2.0 degrees C in the first scenario, up to 2.8
	degrees C in the last one. In both the scenarios (b) and (c), the
	downward component of the surface solar radiation decreased due to
	an increase in the cloud cover over the deforested areas, which contributed
	to a further reduction of the net radiation absorbed at the surface.
	The cloud mechanism, where an increase in albedo is balanced by an
	increase in downward solar radiation, was not detected in any of
	these scenarios. In scenarios (a), (b) and (c), a negative feedback
	mechanism was observed in the hydrological cycle, with greater amounts
	of moisture being carried to the deforested areas. The increase in
	moisture convergence was greater than the reduction in evapotranspiration
	for both scenarios (b) and (c). This result, and the meso-scale thermodynamic
	processes caused an increase in precipitation. A different situation
	was observed in the large-scale deforestation scenario (d): a local
	increase of moisture convergence was observed, but not sufficiently
	intense to generate an increase in precipitation; the local evapotranspiration
	decrease was dominant in this scenario. Therefore, the partial deforestation
	in Amazonia can actually lead to an increase in precipitation locally.
	However, if the deforestation increases, this condition becomes unsustainable,
	leading to drier conditions and, consequently, to reduced precipitation

	We demonstrate that the applied land cover change does not only modify
	the local climate but also change the climate in North Africa and
	the Middle East via teleconnections. Deforestation in the Asian monsoon
	domain enhances the rainfall in North Africa. In parts of the Sahara
	summer precipitation is more than doubled. In contrast, afforestation
	strongly decreases summer rainfall in the Middle East and even leads
	to the cessation of the rainfall-activity in some parts of this region.
	Regarding the local climate, deforestation results in a reduction
	of precipitation and a cooler climate as grass mostly has a higher
	albedo than forests. However, in the core region of the Asian monsoon
	the decrease in evaporative cooling in the monsoon season overcompensates
	this signal and results in a net warming. Afforestation has mainly
	the opposite effect, although the pattern of change is less clear.
	It leads to more precipitation in most parts of the Asian monsoon
	domain and a warmer climate except for the southern regions where
	a stronger evaporation decreases near-surface temperatures in the
	monsoon season. When prescribing mid-Holocene insolation, the pattern
	of local precipitation change differs. Afforestation particularly
	increases monsoon rainfall in the region along the Yellow River which
	was the settlement area of major prehistoric cultures. In this region,
	the effect of land cover change on precipitation is half as large
	as the orbitally-induced precipitation change. Thus, our model results
	reveal that mid-tolate-Holocene land cover change could strongly
	have contributed to the decreasing Asian monsoon precipitation during

	(RCM). Two alternative Land Surface Models (LSMs), a 2nd generation
	LSM (TERRA_ML) and a more advanced 3rd generation LSM (Community
	Land Model version 3.5), and two versions of the atmospheric component
	are tested, as well as a revised coupling procedure allowing for
	variations in diffuse/direct light partitioning at the surface, and
	their accounting by the land surface component. Overall, the RCM
	performance for various variables (e.g., surface fluxes, temperature
	and precipitation) is improved when using the more advanced 3rd generation
	LSM. These improvements are of the same order of magnitude as those
	arising from a new version of the atmospheric component, demonstrating
	the benefit of using a realistic representation of land surface processes
	for regional climate simulations. Taking into account the variability
	in diffuse/direct light partitioning at the surface further improves
	the model performance in terms of summer temperature variability
	at the monthly and daily time scales. Comparisons with observations
	show that the RCM realistically captures temporal variations in diffuse/direct
	light partitioning as well as the evapotranspiration sensitivity
	to these variations. Our results suggest that a modest but consistent
	fraction (up to 3 %) of the overall variability in summer temperature

	We examined station and gridded precipitation observations for the

	century. Increases in precipitation of 15-30% were detected during
	July from the easternmost part of the aquifer to as far downwind

	increase are consistent with the history of Ogallala irrigation and
	mechanisms by which increases in evapotranspiration can affect convection.
	Additionally, we conducted a vapor tracking analysis and found that
	evapotranspiration over the Ogallala Aquifer contributes to downwind
	precipitation and that the contribution is greater when the evapotranspiration
	is higher. This makes it hydrologically possible that the irrigation
	development was associated with the observed precipitation increases.

	50'S, 73 degrees 40'W) in Chile was cleared. Following clearing and
	burning, much of the converted land remains in sparse shrub cover.
	We hypothesized that the arrested conversion back to forests may
	reflect a nearly permanent condition associated with a rise in the
	water table. To evaluate this possibility we acquired data from a
	60-year old evergreen forest and an area in shrub cover to parameterize
	two hydrologic models; one that accounts for hourly interception
	losses and predicts net precipitation (Gash model), the other that
	calculates hourly transpiration from both overstory and understory
	components as well as evaporation from the soil (a modified Penman-Monteith
	model). In addition, standpipes were installed to record water table
	levels over 18 months. The fraction of a total annual precipitation
	(similar to 2100 mm) transpired by shrub and forest cover differed
	(8% versus 22%) roughly in proportion to differences in the leaf
	area index (2.2 versus 5.0). Although whole canopy (stomatal) conductances
	were similar, the aerodynamic conductance was more than three-fold
	higher for forests compared with shrub cover (similar to 12 mol m(-2)
	s(-1) versus 3 mol m(-2) s(-1)). The frequent wetting of tree canopies,
	combined with an average wind speed of 0.74 m s(-1), resulted in
	similar to 30% interception losses from forests compared with 1%
	of annual precipitation lost through this pathway from shrub cover.
	As a result of these differences, only about half of the precipitation
	enters the ground under forest cover compared to 90% under shrub
	cover. This difference in canopy interception losses accounts for
	a rise in the water table from an average of 45-10 cm. The high water
	table prevents normal tree regeneration. This condition is stable
	unless an effort is made to provide an elevated substrate for tree
	seedlings to become established. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	threatens water resources security. At the same time, it is advocated
	for a wide range of other water-related benefits. We review the contributions
	to this special issue and the wider literature, intended as a contribution
	towards a framework for predicting the impact on water resources
	and other water-related issues of afforestation in agricultural landscapes.
	Current evidence suggests that afforestation will typically reduce
	local average water yield as well as low flows. Downstream effects
	on water resources security and river ecosystem health are generally
	likely to be small unless the area afforested is large. In some cases,
	afforestation may increase groundwater recharge and low flows due
	to improved infiltration. Depending on the level of degradation of
	agricultural land, well designed, located and managed forestry can
	reduce the volume of sediment, nutrients and salt volumes transported
	into river systems, although not necessarily their concentrations.
	Afforestation is not likely to reduce major large-scale flooding
	or deep-seated land slides, but may reduce shallow land slides and
	local 'flash' floods. The influence of afforestation on global precipitation
	patterns is complex and land use change would need to occur on a
	large scale to have a discernible influence. Afforestation may influence
	precipitation patterns at local to regional scales by changing surface-
	atmosphere transfers of heat and moisture. Factors determining afforestation
	impacts on water resources security include: (i) plantation characteristics
	that affect forest hydrology (differences in tree physiology, plantation
	design and management, forestry operations), (ii) the benchmark (current
	agricultural use or historic native vegetation) against which changes
	are assessed and (iii) the water system configuration (scale of afforestation,
	timing of impacts, location in the system and internal system losses).
	Similar factors confound the impact of afforestation on other water-related

	three of these in a multi-scale study within the Murray-Darling Basin,
	to assess the impact of plantation forestry on water availability;
	whether these impacts are counterbalanced by stream salinity benefits;
	and to what extent spatial planning can optimise this trade-off.
	Comparison with stream flow data suggested that in medium rainfall
	areas (600-1000 mm year(-1)) runoff generation from agricultural
	land is very similar to that of forested land, implying that reforestation
	in these regions would have a limited stream flow impact. The estimated
	reduction in total surface water resources across the basin due to
	future plantation expansion was estimated at <0.3% by 2020. Plantation
	expansion was not predicted to alter flow regime in large catchments,
	but may do so in catchments smaller than similar to 2000 km(2). Spatial
	planning is likely to increase the effectiveness of reforestation
	against stream salinity by more than seven times. The limited availability
	of suitable areas and the relatively small impact per hectare planted
	appear to rule reforestation out as an effective way to reduce stream
	salinity in the Murray River. Reforestation can help to reduce stream
	salt exports from smaller catchments, but reductions in both average
	stream salinity and high salinity events may be difficult to achieve.
	The available models generally allow us to arrive at these conclusions
	with a reasonable degree of confidence, but the cause(s) of the lower

	causes a reduction in transpiration and reduces frictional convergence
	by decreasing surface roughness. However, precipitation averaged

	decreases when the increase in albedo is greater than 0.03. If surface
	albedo is not increased appreciably as a result of deforestation,
	moisture flux convergence driven by the increase in surface temperature
	can offset the other effects, and average precipitation increases.
	As albedo is increased, surface temperature does not change, but
	surface latent and sensible heat flux decreases due to reduced radiational

	and precipitation. A change in the distribution of precipitation

	which may delay the start of drought, as well as alleviate the effect
	of dry soil on plant water use and carbon uptake. We studied the
	interaction between drought and eCa in a whole-tree chamber experiment
	with Eucalyptus saligna. Trees were grown for 18 months in their
	Ca treatments before a 4-month dry-down. Trees grown in eCa were
	smaller than those grown in ambient Ca (aCa) due to an early growth
	setback that was maintained throughout the duration of the experiment.
	Pre-dawn leaf water potentials were not different between Ca treatments,
	but were lower in the drought treatment than the irrigated control.
	Counter to expectations, the drought treatment caused a larger reduction
	in canopy-average transpiration rates for trees in the eCa treatment
	compared with aCa. Total tree transpiration over the dry-down was
	positively correlated with the decrease in soil water storage, measured
	in the top 1.5 m, over the drying cycle; however, we could not close
	the water budget especially for the larger trees, suggesting soil
	water uptake below 1.5 m depth. Using neutron probe soil water measurements,
	we estimated fractional water uptake to a depth of 4.5 m and found
	that larger trees were able to extract more water from deep soil
	layers. These results highlight the interaction between rooting depth
	and response of tree water use to drought. The responses of tree
	water use to eCa involve interactions between tree size, root distribution
	and soil moisture availability that may override the expected direct
	effects of eCa. It is essential that these interactions be considered
	when interpreting experimental results.},

	The focus of this paper is on the effects of deforestation on land-surface
	processes and regional climate of the Amazon basin. In general, the
	effects of deforestation on climate are likely to depend on the scale
	of the deforested area. In this study, we are interested in the effects
	due to deforestation of areas with a scale of about 250 km. Hence,
	a meso-scale climate model is used in performing numerical experiments
	on the sensitivity of regional climate to deforestation of areas
	with that size. It is found that deforestation results in less net
	surface radiation, less evaporation, less rainfall, and warmer surface
	temperature. The magnitude of the change in temperature is of the
	order of 0.5-degrees-C, the magnitudes of the changes in the other
	variables are of the order of 10%. In order to verify some of the
	results of the numerical experiments, the model simulations of net
	surface radiation are compared to recent observations of net radiation
	over cleared and undisturbed forest in the Amazon. The results of
	the model and the observations agree in the following conclusion:
	the difference in net surface radiation between cleared and undisturbed
	forest is, almost, equally partitioned between net solar radiation
	and net long-wave radiation. This finding contributes to our understanding

  abstract = {Deforestation in the Amazon region will initially impact the energy
	balance at the land surface through changes in land cover and surface
	hydrology. However, continuation of this human activity will eventually
	lead to atmospheric feedbacks, including changes in cloudiness which
	may play an important role in the final equilibrium of solar and
	terrestrial radiation at the surface. In this study, the different
	components of surface radiation over an undisturbed forest in the
	Amazon region are computed using data from the Amazon region micrometerological
	experiment (ARME). Several measures of cloudiness are defined: two
	estimated from the terrestrial radiation measurements, and one from
	the solar radiation measurements. The sensitivity of the surface
	fluxes of solar and terrestrial radiation to natural variability
	in cloudiness is investigated to infer the potential role of the
	cloudiness feedback in the surface energy balance. The results of
	this analysis indicate that a 1% decrease in cloudiness would increase
	net solar radiation by ca. 1.6 W/m(2). However, the overall magnitude
	of this feedback, due to total deforestation of the Amazon forest,
	is likely to be of the same order as the magnitude of the decrease
	in net solar radiation due to the observed increase in surface albedo
	following deforestation. Hence, the total change in net solar radiation
	is likely to have a negligible magnitude. In contrast to this conclusion,
	we find that terrestrial radiation is likely to be more strongly
	affected; reduced cloudiness will decrease net terrestrial radiation;
	a 1% decrease in cloudiness induces a reduction in net terrestrial
	radiation of ca. 0.7 W/m(2); this process augments the similar effects
	of the predicted warming and drying in the boundary layer. Due to
	the cloudiness feedback, the most significant effect of large-scale
	deforestation on the surface energy balance is likely to be in the
	modification of the terrestrial radiation field rather than the classical
	albedo effect on solar radiation fields. The net effect of clouds
	is to reduce net radiation; a 1% increase in cloudiness induces a
	reduction in net radiation of ca. 1 W/m(2). The implications of this
	negative feedback on large-scale land-atmosphere interactions over

	This variability appears as fluctuations around several distinct
	and preferred moisture states. These fluctuations and transitions

	changes in atmospheric circulation patterns possibly caused by oceanic
	influence. This paper argues that a major contributing factor to
	the persistent dry or moist behavior could be due to feedback and
	nonlinear interaction between the components of the hydrologic cycle
	in both the land and the atmosphere. A model that couples the water
	balance of continental landmasses and the overlying atmosphere is
	presented. The large-scale variabilities in atmospheric circulation
	are introduced by way of simple randomness in key forcing parameters.
	The result is a multiplicative-noise stochastic differential equation
	for the water balance dynamics of continental-type climates that
	includes land surface-atmosphere interaction. The solution to this
	differential equation exhibits a bimodal probability distribution
	function for soil moisture and precipitation. Extended periods of
	anomalous dry conditions (drought) or alternatively wet conditions
	(pluvial), with abrupt transitions between them, are present in the

	floods, reservoir sedimentation) in cultivated areas of the European
	loess belt. This study aimed to determine the impact of rainfall
	seasonality and land use change on soil erosion over the last 40
	years in a 94-ha cultivated catchment of Normandy (France). To this
	end, scenarios representative of the different land use conditions
	were simulated using the STREAM expert-based erosion model. A 13
	years long sequence of rainfall events was run with this model. Results
	showed that erosion increased dramatically after land consolidation
	(+168% on average). Interannual variability of erosion is important.
	After land consolidation, 79% of erosion was observed in summer and
	autumn, even though these seasons only accounted for 58% of annual
	rainfall kinetic energy. The bulk of erosion was hence produced by
	a few intense thunderstorms during this period. Thunderstorms correspond
	to 5% of rainfall events and to 15% of the total rainfall depth,
	but they generate 51% of total annual erosion after land consolidation
	(and up to 57% of erosion before land consolidation). Confrontation
	of the STREAM model outputs with the erosion rates modelled based
	on Cs-137 measurements suggested that soil redistribution within
	the catchment was very high but that sediment exports from the catchment
	remained limited (sediment delivery ratio between 1% and 10%). Local
	erosion rates derived from Cs-137 measurements showed an important
	and organised spatial variability, but erosion rates integrated over
	larger areas remained in the same order of magnitude as those simulated
	by the STREAM model or were slightly higher. Water erosion would
	hence not be the only process generating erosion within this catchment.
	In this context, our results show that tillage erosion cannot be
	neglected to calculate the sediment budget over several decades.

	System to simulate dry season orographic cloudiness, rainfall, and
	orographic flow patterns over Kilimanjaro for current deforested
	and reforested land cover scenarios. The simulations for current
	land cover show satisfactory performance compared to surface meteorology
	and satellite-observed cloudiness. Clouds occur less frequently in
	response to deforestation, with the magnitude of decrease increasing
	with deforestation. On the windward side, cloud liquid water path
	(LWP) and precipitation both show decreases at lower elevations (similar
	to 1000-2000 m) and increases at higher elevations (2000-4000 m)
	in response to deforestation. This pattern is caused by decreased
	aerodynamic resistance, leading to enhanced wind speeds and convergence
	at higher elevations. On the lee regions, LWP deficits found in deforested
	simulations coincide with regions of reduced moisture while precipitation
	increased slightly at lower elevations (1000-1800 m) and decreased
	at higher elevations (1800-4000 m). Kilimanjaro offers less obstruction
	to background airflow, and reduced moisture transport to the lee
	side is found for deforested conditions, causing reduced LWP and
	rainfall. However, land use change has little effect on cloudiness
	and rainfall at elevations in excess of 4000 m and is not expected
	to impact glaciers in the summit zone of Kilimanjaro during the dry

	contribution of the sensible heat flux to the total turbulent heat
	transport, resulting in an averaged day-time Bowen ratio of beta
	= H/lambda E approximate to 1. Seasonality of beta did mainly coincide
	with the seasonal course of precipitation, which amounted to 1970
	mm yr(-1) during the investigated period. The findings are compared
	to invastigations at four neotropical rain forests where daytime
	beta were substantially smaller than 1. All discussed sites received
	similar incident short wave radiation, however, precipitation at
	the neotropical sites was much higher. Our first observations in
	a nearby Indonesian upland rain forest where precipitation was comparable
	to that at the cacao AFS showed an intermediate behaviour. Differences
	in beta between the cacao AFS and the tropical forests are discussed
	as a consequence of differing precipitation amounts, and albedo.
	From these comparisons we conclude that conversion from tropical

	are gaining attention globally and will alter many ecosystem processes,

	and water yield, while the effects of afforestation on water yield
	have been considered for some regions. However, to our knowledge
	no systematic global analysis of the effects of afforestation on
	water yield has been undertaken. To assess and predict these effects
	globally, we analyzed 26 catchment data sets with 504 observations,
	including annual runoff and low flow. We examined changes in the
	context of several variables, including original vegetation type,
	plantation species, plantation age, and mean annual precipitation
	(MAP). All of these variables should be useful for understanding
	and modeling the effects of afforestation on water yield. We found
	that annual runoff was reduced on average by 44% (+/- 3%) and 31%
	(+/- 2%) when grasslands and shrublands were afforested, respectively.
	Eucalypts had a larger impact than other tree species in afforested
	grasslands (P=0.002), reducing runoff (90) by 75% (+/- 10%), compared
	with a 40% (+/- 3%) average decrease with pines. Runoff losses increased
	significantly with plantation age for at least 20 years after planting,
	whether expressed as absolute changes (mm) or as a proportion of
	predicted runoff (%) (P < 0.001). For grasslands, absolute reductions
	in annual runoff were greatest at wetter sites, but proportional
	reductions were significantly larger in drier sites (P < 0.01 and
	P < 0.001, respectively). Afforestation effects on low flow were
	similar to those on total annual flow, but proportional reductions
	were even larger for low flow (P < 0.001). These results clearly
	demonstrate that reductions in runoff can be expected following afforestation
	of grasslands and shrublands and may be most severe in drier regions.
	Our results suggest that, in a region where natural runoff is less
	than 10% of MAP, afforestation should result in a complete loss of
	runoff; where natural runoff is 30% of precipitation, it will likely
	be cut by half or more when trees are planted. The possibility that
	afforestation could cause or intensify water shortages in many locations
	is a tradeoff that should be explicitly addressed in carbon sequestration
	programs.},

  abstract = { The water table in southwestern Niger has been rising continuously
	for the past decades (4 m rise from 1963 to 2007), despite a Ã¢Ë†Â¼23%
	deficit in monsoonal rainfall from 1970 to 1998. This paradoxical
	phenomenon has been linked with a change in land use from natural
	savannah to millet crops that have expanded in area sixfold since
	1950 and have caused soil crusting on slopes that has, in turn, enhanced
	Hortonian runoff. Runoff concentrates in closed ponds and then recharges
	the aquifer; therefore, higher runoff increases aquifer recharge.
	At the local scale (2 km2), a physically based, distributed hydrological
	model showed that land clearing increased runoff threefold, whereas
	the rainfall deficit decreased runoff by a factor of 2. At a larger
	scale (500 km2, 1950Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1992 period), historical aerial photographs
	showed a 2.5-fold increase in the density of gullies, in response
	to an 80% decrease in perennial vegetation. At the scale of the entire
	study area (5000 km2), analytical modeling of groundwater radioisotope
	data (3H and 14C) showed that the recharge rate prior to land clearing
	(1950s) was about 2 mm aÃ¢Ë†â€™1; postclearing recharge, estimated
	from groundwater level fluctuations and constrained by subsurface
	geophysical surveys, was estimated to be 25 Ã‚Â± 7 mm aÃ¢Ë†â€™1.
	This order of magnitude increase in groundwater fluxes has also impacted
	groundwater quality near ponds, as shown by a rising trend in groundwater
	nitrate concentrations of natural origin (75% of ÃŽÂ´15N values in
	the range +4 to +8Ã¢â‚¬Â°). In this well-documented region of semiarid
	Africa, the indirect impacts of land use change on water quantity

	on the woody structure of a north Australian savanna never grazed
	by domestic stock. Location The study was conducted in a 500Â ha
	pocket of Eucalyptus-dominated savanna surrounded by a late Quaternary
	lava flow. The flow is known as the Great Basalt Wall, located c.
	50Â km northeast of Charters Towers in semi-arid north-eastern Australia.
	This region was exposed to the largest 5-year rainfall deficit on
	record between 1992 and 1996. Methods All individual woody plants
	were tagged within a 1.56Â ha plot. Species were segregated into
	their habitat affinities (rain forest, ecotone, savanna) and regeneration
	strategy (resprouter, seeder). The survivorship of plants within
	these categories was analysed in relation to fire intensity from
	the first fire, and to each of four fires lit between 1996 and 2001.
	Results Before the first fire, the plot contained thirty-one tree
	species including twenty-one typical of the surrounding dry rain
	forest. These rain forest species were represented by small individuals
	and constituted <1% of the total basal area of woody plants. The
	basal area of savanna trees was 7.5Â m2Â haâˆ’1 at the commencement
	of monitoring, although 31% had recently died and others had major
	crown damage. Further death of the drought debilitated savanna trees
	was substantial during the first year of monitoring and the basal
	area of live savanna trees declined to 1.1Â m2Â haâˆ’1 after 5Â years.
	Most species from both rain forest and savanna were classified as
	resprouters and are capable of regenerating from underground organs
	after fire. Species without this ability (rain forest seeders and
	ecotone seeders) were mostly eliminated after the first two consecutive
	fires. Among resprouters, survivorship declined as fire intensity
	increased and this was more pronounced for rain forest than for savanna
	species. Repeated burning produced a cumulative effect of decreasing
	survivorship for rain forest resprouters relative to savanna resprouters.
	Main conclusions The study provides evidence that savanna and rain
	forest trees differ in fire susceptibility and that recurrent fire
	can explain the restricted distribution of rain forest in the seasonally
	arid Australian tropics. The time of death of the savanna trees is
	consistent with the regional pattern after severe drought, and highlights
	the importance of medium term climate cycles for the population dynamics
	of savanna tree species and structure of Australian savannas.},

  abstract = {The role of land surface-related processes and feedbacks during the
	record-breaking 2003 European summer heat wave is explored with a
	regional climate model. All simulations are driven by lateral boundary
	conditions and sea surface temperatures from the ECMWF operational
	analysis and 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis ( ERA-40), thereby prescribing
	the large-scale circulation. In particular, the contribution of soil
	moisture anomalies and their interactions with the atmosphere through
	latent and sensible heat fluxes is investigated. Sensitivity experiments
	are performed by perturbing spring soil moisture in order to determine
	its influence on the formation of the heat wave. A multiyear regional
	climate simulation for 1970-2000 using a fixed model setup is used
	as the reference period. A large precipitation deficit together with
	early vegetation green-up and strong positive radiative anomalies
	in the months preceding the extreme summer event contributed to an
	early and rapid loss of soil moisture, which exceeded the multiyear
	average by far. The exceptionally high temperature anomalies, most
	pronounced in June and August 2003, were initiated by persistent
	anticyclonic circulation anomalies that enabled a dominance of the
	local heat balance. In this experiment the hottest phase in early
	August is realistically simulated despite the absence of an anomaly
	in total surface net radiation. This indicates an important role
	of the partitioning of net radiation in latent and sensible heat
	fluxes, which is to a large extent controlled by soil moisture. The
	lack of soil moisture strongly reduced latent cooling and thereby
	amplified the surface temperature anomalies. The evaluation of the
	experiments with perturbed spring soil moisture shows that this quantity
	is an important parameter for the evolution of European heat waves.
	Simulations indicate that without soil moisture anomalies the summer
	heat anomalies could have been reduced by around 40% in some regions.
	Moreover, drought conditions are revealed to influence the tropospheric
	circulation by producing a surface heat low and enhanced ridging
	in the midtroposphere. This suggests a positive feedback mechanism
	between soil moisture, continental-scale circulation, and temperature.},

	relationships with rainfall, land cover, and population in West Africa.
	This particular region was selected because it has become a focal

	deforestation. Our analyses revealed that albedo and rainfall were
	related only modestly at short time scales (monthly and annual) and
	that mean annual albedo values remained relatively stable from 1982-1989
	over a widerange of climatic and vegetation zones in West Africa.
	The relationship between long-term mean rainfall and mean albedo
	was strong and curvilinear(r2 = 0.802). The same was true for the
	relationship betweenpercent tree cover and mean albedo (r2 = 0.659).
	These results suggest that long-term climate patterns, which control
	vegetation type and canopy structure, have greater influence on albedo
	than short-term fluctuations in rainfall. Our results reinforce other
	recent studies based on satellite data that have questioned the extent

	The model is set up at the scale of the meteorological station plot

	A snow parameter is modified to account for the fact that the model

	fact that all other parameters are set a priori on the basis of local
	properties of the surface. The results show that the dependence of
	bare soil albedo on soil moisture, which causes an increase in the

	version 3 (RegCM3), coupled to two land surface schemes: the Biosphere
	Atmosphere Transfer System, version le (BATS1e), and the Integrated
	Biosphere Simulator (IBIS). The model's performance in simulating
	precipitation over the Maritime Continent was evaluated against the
	3-hourly Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Multisatellite
	Precipitation Analysis 3B42 product. It is found that the model suffers
	from three major errors in reproducing the observed rainfall histogram:
	underestimation of the frequency of dry periods, overestimation of
	the frequency of low-intensity rainfall, and underestimation of the
	frequency of high-intensity rainfall. Additionally, the model does
	not accurately reproduce the observed timing of the diurnal rainfall
	peak, particularly over land. These four errors persisted regardless
	of the choice of lateral boundary conditions, convective parameterization
	scheme, or land surface scheme. The magnitude of the wet dry bias
	in the simulated volumes of rainfall was, however, strongly dependent
	on the choice of the convection scheme and lateral boundary conditions.
	The Grell convection scheme with Fritsch-Chappell closure was the
	best performing of the convection schemes, having the smallest error
	magnitudes in both the rainfall histogram and average diurnal cycle,
	and also having good representation of the land surface energy and
	evapotranspiration components. The 40-yr ECMWF Re-Analysis (ERA-40)
	was found to produce better simulations of observed rainfall when
	used as lateral boundary conditions than did the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis.
	Discussion of the nature of the major model errors is provided, along
	with some suggestions for improvement.},

	for the decomposition as a key process of ecosystem carbon (C) and

	grazing on shoot and root decomposition with the litter bag method
	in a long-term grazing exclosure (UG79), a moderate winter grazed
	(WG) and a long-term heavily grazed site (HG). We separated the effects
	of local environmental factors and litter quality as altered by grazing.
	Growing seasons of average and very low precipitation allowed us
	to study the effect of inter annual rainfall variability on decomposition.
	Grazing-induced differences in environmental factors of the three
	studied grassland sites had no effect on decay rates of shoot and
	root dry mass. Also differences in litter quality among the grazing
	sites were not reflected by root decomposition dynamics. The accelerated
	shoot decay at site HG could not clearly be linked to litter quality
	parameters. Shoot decay rates were more or less constant, even under
	very dry conditions. This indicates the possibility of photodegradation
	(solar UV-B radiation) to control aboveground decomposition in this
	semi-arid ecosystem. By selecting the best predictors of root decomposition
	from regression analysis, we found that soil water content was the
	best parameter explaining the dynamics. Net N immobilization was
	generally not detected during the decay process of shoot and root.
	It is likely, when root decomposition is strongly reduced in dry
	periods, shoot decomposition becomes relatively more important for
	nutrient cycling. A separate analysis of shoot and root decay dynamics
	is required in order to describe C and N cycling in this semi-arid
	grassland. The grazing impact on C and N fluxes through decomposition
	of plant material likely exhibits a strong interaction with seasonal
	rainfall pattern. (C) 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Application of the model to eucalypt communities in the Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) in Australia required both modification and testing of the model. 2. A soil evaporation component was added following Ritchie (1972). Leaf water potential, originally expressed as a function of soil water content (given as a fraction of field capacity), was altered to reflect soil water potential. To model better the interaction between the evaporation of free intercepted water from the canopy and transpiration, the model was modified after McNaughton & Black (1973) to reflect the suppression of transpiration by a wet canopy. 3. The modified model was tested against data from two Australian plant communities. The first data set was a lysimeter study of water loss from a coastal eucalypt forest; the second soil moisture data set was from a semi-arid eucalypt woodland in the MDB. Predicted soil water deficits agreed well with observed values in both systems. The study demonstrated the potential of such a model for estimating how changes in land cover or climate might affect local and regional water balances.},

	of the European climate with respect to continental-scale anthropogenic
	vegetation changes. An ensemble of six control integrations with
	present-day vegetation parameters (April until August, 1987-1992)
	is compared against an ensemble of six sensitivity experiments (for
	the same time period and years) using a potential distribution as
	obtained from a vegetation model. The two vegetation distributions
	differ strongly in the Mediterranean region, reflecting the anthropogenic
	deforestation that took place during the last 2000 years. The numerical
	simulations reveal that the additional vegetation in the sensitivity
	experiment leads to a moister and cooler spring, followed by a drier
	and warmer summer. The following key physical processes were identified:
	Evapotranspiration is increased in the simulation with potential
	vegetation during the period from April until mid-July, thus cooling
	the Earth surface, moistening the boundary layer, reducing vertical
	stability, and eventually enhancing precipitation. In mid-July, soil
	moisture values in the experiment with potential vegetation drop
	locally below a critical value (as a consequence of the larger springtime
	evapotranspiration rates), whereupon transpiration is almost completely
	inhibited during the following 2 months. This leads to a sign reversal
	of the sensitivity to vegetation cover. This contrasting behavior
	during spring and summer is consistently simulated for all 6 years
	considered. The results thus demonstrate that vegetation substantially
	impacts upon the summertime climate in the Mediterranean region.},

	and strongly affects the delicate balance of processes that determines
	the surface climate in response to larger-scale forcings. Previous
	studies using parameterized convection have found that the feedback
	between soil moisture and precipitation is predominantly positive
	(more precipitation over wet soils) over Europe. Here this feedback
	is investigated for one full month (July 2006) over the Alpine region
	using two different model configurations. The first one employs regional
	climate simulations performed with the Consortium for Small-Scale
	Modeling Model in Climate Mode (CCLM) on a grid spacing of 25 km.
	The second one uses the same model but integrated on a cloud-resolving
	grid of 2.2 km, allowing an explicit treatment of convection. Each
	configuration comprises one control and two sensitivity experiments.
	The latter start from perturbed soil moisture initial conditions.
	Comparison of the simulated soil moisture-precipitation feedback
	reveals significant differences between the two systems. The 25-km
	simulations sustain a strong positive feedback, while those at 2.2-km
	resolution are associated with a predominantly negative feedback.
	Thus the two systems yield not only different strengths of this key
	feedback but also different signs. This has important implications,
	with the cloud-resolving model exhibiting a shorter soil moisture
	memory and a smaller soil moisture-temperature feedback. Analysis
	shows that the different feedback signs relate to the sensitivity
	of the simulated convective development to the presence of a stable
	layer sitting on top of the planetary boundary layer. In the 2.2-km
	integrations, dry initial soil moisture conditions yield more vigorous
	thermals (owing to stronger daytime heating), which can more easily
	break through the stable air barrier, thereby leading to deep convection
	and ultimately to a negative soil moisture-precipitation feedback
	loop. In the 25-km integrations, deep convection is much less sensitive
	to the stable layer because of the design of the employed convective
	parameterization. The authors also show that there are considerable
	differences in the simulated soil moisture-precipitation feedback

	during the postdam period where the 99th percentile of precipitation
	experienced an average of 4% increase per year in magnitude. While
	the density of dams within a given radius did not correlate tangibly
	with the change in the percentile value, the frequency of rain (average

  abstract = {Abstract  This review summarizes recent research in Australia on:
	(i) climate and geophysical trends over the last few decades; (ii)
	projections for climate change in the 21st century; (iii) predicted
	impacts from modelling studies on particular ecosystems and native
	species; and (iv) ecological effects that have apparently occurred
	as a response to recent warming. Consistent with global trends, Australia
	has warmed ∼0.8°C over the last century with minimum temperatures
	warming faster than maxima. There have been significant regional
	trends in rainfall with the northern, eastern and southern parts
	of the continent receiving greater rainfall and the western region
	receiving less. Higher rainfall has been associated with an increase
	in the number of rain days and heavy rainfall events. Sea surface
	temperatures on the Great Barrier Reef have increased and are associated
	with an increase in the frequency and severity of coral bleaching
	and mortality. Sea level rises in Australia have been regionally
	variable, and considerably less than the global average. Snow cover
	and duration have declined significantly at some sites in the Snowy
	Mountains. CSIRO projections for future climatic changes indicate
	increases in annual average temperatures of 0.4-2.0°C by 2030 (relative
	to 1990) and 1.0-6.0°C by 2070. Considerable uncertainty remains
	as to future changes in rainfall, El Niño Southern Oscillation events
	and tropical cyclone activity. Overall increases in potential evaporation
	over much of the continent are predicted as well as continued reductions
	in the extent and duration of snow cover. Future changes in temperature
	and rainfall are predicted to have significant impacts on most vegetation
	types that have been modelled to date, although the interactive effect
	of continuing increases in atmospheric CO2 has not been incorporated
	into most modelling studies. Elevated CO2 will most likely mitigate
	some of the impacts of climate change by reducing water stress. Future
	impacts on particular ecosystems include increased forest growth,
	alterations in competitive regimes between C3 and C4 grasses, increasing
	encroachment of woody shrubs into arid and semiarid rangelands, continued
	incursion of mangrove communities into freshwater wetlands, increasing
	frequency of coral bleaching, and establishment of woody species
	at increasingly higher elevations in the alpine zone. Modelling of
	potential impacts on specific Australian taxa using bioclimatic analysis
	programs such as bioclim consistently predicts contraction and/or
	fragmentation of species' current ranges. The bioclimates of some
	species of plants and vertebrates are predicted to disappear entirely
	with as little as 0.5-1.0°C of warming. Australia lacks the long-term
	datasets and tradition of phenological monitoring that have allowed
	the detection of climate-change-related trends in the Northern Hemisphere.
	Long-term changes in Australian vegetation can be mostly attributed
	to alterations in fire regimes, clearing and grazing, but some trends,
	such as encroachment of rainforest into eucalypt woodlands, and establishment
	of trees in subalpine meadows probably have a climatic component.

	the Holt-Winters algorithm, for investigating non-stationarity in
	environmental time series are presented. They are applied to monthly
	rainfall and average maximum temperature time series of lengths between
	38 and 108 years, from six stations in the Murray Darling Basin and
	four cities in eastern Australia. The first analysis focuses on the
	residuals after fitting regression models which allow for seasonal
	variation, the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and the Southern
	Oscillation Index (SOI). The models provided evidence that rainfall
	is reduced during periods of negative SOI, and that the interaction
	between PDO and SOI pronounces this effect during periods of negative
	PDO. Following this, there was no evidence of any trend in either
	the PDO or SOI time series. The residuals from this regression were
	analysed with a cumulative sum (CUSUM) technique, and the statistical
	significance was assessed using a Monte Carlo method. The residuals
	were also analysed for volatility, autocorrelation, long-range dependence
	and spatial correlation. For all ten rainfall and temperature time
	series, CUSUM plots of the residuals provided evidence of non-stationarity
	for both temperature and rainfall, after removing seasonal effects
	and the effects of PDO and SOI. Rainfall was generally lower in the
	first half of the twentieth century and higher during the second
	half. However, it decreased again over the last 10 years. This pattern
	was highlighted with 5-year moving average plots. The residuals for
	temperature showed a complementary pattern with increases in temperature
	corresponding to decreased rainfall. The second analysis decomposed
	the rainfall and temperature time series into random variation about
	an underlying level, trend and additive seasonal effects and changes
	in the level; trend and seasonal effects were tracked using a Holt-Winters
	algorithm. The results of this analysis were qualitatively similar
	to those of the regression analysis. Copyright © 2010 John Wiley

	produce very different precipitation (P) over the Southwest including

	to isolate the impact of local E and the large-scale flow. Both regional
	model experiments and diagnostics support the following physical
	mechanism: There is an increase in E in the realistic simulation
	due to the change in land surface physics. This increase in E is
	compensated by the decrease in sensible heat, which leads to the
	colder land surface. Associated with this cooling, the surface pressure
	raises and the Southwest heat low weakens due to the increase in
	the surface pressure. This alters the large-scale low-level circulation
	and increases the occurrence of the low-level moisture surge events
	from the Gulf of California into AZNM, and accordingly, increases
	P. The mechanism is also found in observations of day-to-day variation

	significant transboundary natural ecosystems in Africa. The catchment
	constitutes about one third of the catchment area of Lake Tanganyika
	and contains ecosystems of both national and international importance
	(i.e. Muyovozi Wetland Ramsar site). It has been increasingly said
	that increased anthropogenic activities have had negative impacts
	on the Muyovozi wetland in particular and other catchment resources.
	Nevertheless, these beliefs are little supported by quantitative
	data. A study on the dynamics of land use and cover in the Malagarasi
	river catchment therefore investigated long-term and seasonal changes
	that have occurred as a result of human activities in the area for
	the periods between 1984 and 2001. Landsat TM and ETM+ images were
	used to locate and quantify the changes. Perceptions of local people
	on historical changes and drivers for the changes were also collected
	and integrated in the assessment. The study revealed a significant
	change in land use and cover within a period of 18 year. Between
	1984 and 2001, the woodland and wetland vegetation covers declined
	by 0.09% and 2.51% per year. Areas with settlements and cultivation
	increased by 1.05% annually while bushed grassland increased at 1.93%
	annually. The perceived principal drivers for the changes were found
	to include fire, cultivation along rivers and lake shores, overgrazing,
	poor law enforcement, insufficient knowledge on environmental issues,
	increasing poverty, deforestation and population growth. The human
	population growth rate stands at 4.8% against a national figure of
	2.9%. The most perceived environmental problems include drying of
	streams and rivers, change in rainfall, loss of soil fertility, soil
	erosion and reduced crop yield. The study concludes that, there has
	been significant changes in land use and cover in the catchment and
	these require concerted actions to reverse the changes. The study
	highlights the importance of integrating remote sensing and local
	knowledge in understanding the dynamics catchment resources and generating
	information that could be used to overcome the catchment management
	problems. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	where the fluxes are in close agreement with the daily mean fluxes

	are used for the land surface parameters for all non glaciated land
	regions. At the other extreme, a second simulation is performed ('green

	triples in the presence of the 'green planet', land precipitation
	doubles (as a second order effect) and near surface temperatures
	are lower by as much as 8 K in the seasonal mean resulting from the
	increase in latent heat flux. The differences can be understood in
	terms of more absorbed radiation at the surface and increased recycling
	of water. Most of the increase in net surface radiation originates
	from less thermal radiative loss and not from increases in solar
	radiation which would be expected from the albedo change. To illustrate
	the differences in climatic character and what it would imply for
	the vegetation type, we use the Koppen climate classification. Both
	cases lead to similar classifications in the extra tropics and South
	America indicating that the character of the climate is not substantially
	altered in these regions. Fundamental changes occur over Africa,
	South Asia and Australia, where large regions are classified as arid
	(grassland/desert) climate in the 'desert world' simulation while
	classified as a forest climate in the 'green planet' simulation as
	a result of the strong influence of maximum vegetation on the climate.

	climate regime, two sets of two five-member ensembles of 28-day simulations
	were conducted using the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University-National
	Center for Atmospheric Research Mesoscale Model (MM5) coupled to
	the "Noah" land surface model. The four ensembles represented conditions
	in summer ( August) and winter ( February) across the northern mid-Atlantic

	Prelogging ensembles prescribed a vegetative cover of an evergreen

	and bare soil to simulate clear-cut deforestation. The results of
	the MM5 experiments showed a decided seasonality in the response
	of the land surface-atmosphere system to deforestation, with much
	stronger effects arising in summer. In August, deforestation caused
	a repartitioning of the surface energy budget, beginning with a decrease
	in the latent heat flux of more than 60 W m(-2) across the land cover-forcing
	area, representing almost one-half of the latent heat flux under
	prelogging land cover. Concomitant with this decrease in evapotranspiration,
	mean 2-m air temperatures warmed by at least 1.5 degrees C. Increases
	in sensible heat flux led to a 150-m mean increase in the height
	of the atmospheric boundary layer over the deforested area. Low-level
	atmospheric mixing ratios and total precipitation decreased under
	clear-cut conditions. Mean soil moisture increased in all model levels
	to 150 cm because of a decrease in vegetative uptake of water, except
	at the 5-cm level at which such decreases were effectively balanced
	by greater soil evaporation and less precipitation. A strong diurnal
	variation in the response to deforestation of ground and lower-atmosphere
	temperatures and heat fluxes was also identified for the summer season.
	The February simulations showed the effects of deforestation during
	low-insolation months to be small and variable. The strong response
	of the summer land surface-atmosphere system to deforestation shown
	here suggests that land cover changes can appreciably affect regional
	climates. Thus, the role of human-induced and naturally occurring
	land cover variability should not be ignored in the attribution of
	climate change.},

	that transpiration is the dominant component on the global scale,
	followed by soil evaporation and canopy evaporation. The Community
	Land Model version 3 (CLM3), however, does not reflect this global
	view of ET partitioning, with soil evaporation and canopy evaporation
	far outweighing transpiration. One consequence of this unrealistic
	ET partitioning in CLM3 is that photosynthesis, which is linked to
	transpiration through stomatal conductance, is significantly underestimated
	on a global basis. A number of modifications to CLM3 vegetation and
	soil hydrology parameterizations are described that improve ET partitioning
	and reduce an apparent dry soil bias in CLM3. The modifications reduce
	canopy interception and evaporation, reduce soil moisture stress
	on transpiration, increase transpiration through a more realistic
	canopy integration scheme, reduce within-canopy soil evaporation,
	eliminate lateral drainage of soil water, increase infiltration of
	water into the soil, and increase the vertical redistribution of
	soil water. The partitioning of ET is improved, with notable increases
	seen in transpiration (13%-41% of global ET) and photosynthesis (65-148
	Pg C yr1). Soils are wetter and exhibit a far more distinct soil
	moisture annual cycle and greater interseasonal soil water storage,
	which permits plants to sustain transpiration through the dry season.
	The broader influences of improved ET partitioning on land-atmosphere
	interaction are diverse. Stronger transpiration and reduced canopy
	evaporation yield an extended ET response to rain events and a shift
	in the precipitation distribution toward more frequent small- to
	medium-size rain events. Soil moisture memory time scales decrease
	particularly at deeper soil levels. Subsurface soil moisture exerts
	a slightly greater influence on precipitation. These results indicate
	that partitioning of ET is an important responsibility for land surface

  school = {University of Queensland},
  year = {2004},
  type = {PhD thesis},
  address = {Brisbane, Queensland, Australia},
  abstract = {Australian land cover has been significantly altered since European
	settlement, primarily for agricultural utilisation, with native vegetation
	widely replaced or modified for cropping and intensive animal production.
	While there have been numerous investigations into the regional and
	near surface climate impacts of Australian land cover change, these
	investigations have not included the climate impacts of larger-scale
	changes in atmospheric circulation and their associated feedbacks,
	or the impacts of longer-term soil moisture feedbacks. In this research
	the CSIRO General Circulation Model (GCM) was used to investigate
	the climate impacts of Australian land cover change, with larger-scale
	and longer-term feedbacks included. 
	
	To avoid the common problem of overstating the magnitude and spatial
	extent of changes in land surface conditions prescribed in GCM land
	cover change experiments, the current Australian land surface properties
	were described from finer-scale, satellite derived land cover datasets,
	with land surface conditions extrapolating from remnant native vegetation
	to pre-clearing extents to recreate the pre-clearing land surface
	properties. Aggregation rules were applied to the fine-scale data
	to generate the land surface parameters of the GCM, ensuring the
	equivalent sub-grid heterogeneity and land surface biogeophysics
	were captured in both the current and pre-clearing land surface parameters.
	
	
	The differences in climate simulated in the pre-clearing and current
	experiments were analysed for changes in Australian continental and
	regional climate to assess the modelled climate impacts of Australian
	land cover change. The changes in modelled climate were compared
	to observed changes in Australian precipitation over the last 50
	and 100 years to assess whether modelled results could be detected
	in the historical record. The differences in climate simulation also
	were analysed at the global scale to assess the impacts of local
	changes on larger scale circulation and climate at distance from
	the land cover changes. 
	
	The Australian continental and regional analyses demonstrated that
	Australian land cover change did have statistically significant impacts
	on air temperature and precipitation simulated in the CSIRO GCM.
	The statistically significant DJF warming and drying modelled over
	south east Queensland, with causal links back to historical land
	cover change in the region, corresponded with strong drying trends
	over the last 50 years for the region. As this region and the areas
	to the north and west, continue to be actively cleared, this has
	significant implications for land use management planning in Queensland.
	
	
	The statistically significant increase in JJA precipitation modelled
	over south west Western Australia was opposite to the observed drying
	trends identified from 100 and 50 year analyses of observed precipitation.
	This result was significant for the region, as it demonstrated that
	the increased JJA latent heat fluxes over agricultural land had the
	potential to increase cloud cover and precipitation. This finding
	supported field studies and satellite observations over the region
	that showed winter latent heat fluxes were higher over agricultural
	land than over adjacent native vegetation, and preferentially formed
	cumulus clouds with higher water content over the agricultural land.
	The modelling results therefore suggest the strong drying trend over
	south west Western Australia has been in response to other climatic
	forcing, rather than from historical land cover change. 
	
	The global analysis identified global scale changes in atmospheric
	circulation responding to the changes in circulation around Australia.
	A change in the DJF Australian monsoon flow appeared to influence
	the wind flow across the Indian and Pacific oceans, with impacts
	on air temperature and precipitation in Asia, Europe and North America,
	as well as in Australia. The changes in cloud cover, soil moisture
	and snow cover over these areas resulted in larger changes in surface
	fluxes than occurred over the regions of Australian land cover change.
	A northward shift in JJA mid latitude westerly wind flow around Australia,
	had impacts over Australia and further to the north, resulting in
	a northward shift and increased flow in the JJA Asian monsoon. The
	increased Asian monsoon flow impacted the wind flow and circulation
	over the Indian and Pacific oceans, with impacts on air temperature,
	and precipitation over Asia, Europe and North America. Again the
	changes in cloud cover and soil moisture over these areas resulted
	in larger changes in surface fluxes than occurred over the regions
	of Australia land cover change.},

  abstract = {Recently, (Pitman et al., 2009) found a wide range of bio-geophysical
	climate impacts from historical land cover change when modelled in
	a suite of current global climate models (GCMs). The bio-geophysical
	climate impacts of human land cover change, however, have been investigated
	by a wide range of general circulation modelling, regional climate
	modelling, and observational studies. In this regard the IPCC 4th
	assessment report specifies radiative cooling of 0.2 W/m(2) as the
	dominant global impact of human land cover change since 1750, but
	states this has a low to medium level of scientific understanding.
	To further contribute to the understanding of the possible climatic
	impacts of anthropogenic land cover change, we have performed a series
	of land cover change experiments with the community land model (CLM)
	within the community climate system model (CCSM). To do this we have
	developed a new set of potential vegetation land surface parameters
	to represent land cover change in CLM. The new parameters are consistent
	with the potential vegetation biome mapping of (Ramankutty and Foley,
	1999), with the plant functional types (PFTs) and plant phenology
	consistent with the current day Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer
	(MODIS) land surface parameters of (Lawrence and Chase, 2007). We
	found that land cover change in CCSM resulted in widespread regional
	warming of the near surface atmosphere, but with limited global impact
	on near surface temperatures. The experiments also found changes
	in precipitation, with drier conditions regionally, but with limited
	impact on average global precipitation. Analysis of the surface fluxes
	in the CCSM experiments found the current day warming was predominantly
	driven by changes in surface hydrology through reduced evapo-transpiration
	and latent heat flux, with the radiative forcing playing a secondary
	role. We show that these finding are supported by a wide range of
	observational field studies, satellite studies and regional and global

	2005 and for the four representative concentration pathway (RCP)
	scenarios from 2006 to 2100. Analysis of the biogeochemical impacts
	of land cover change in CCSM4 reveals that the model produced a historical
	cumulative land use flux of 127.7 PgC from 1850 to 2005, which is
	in general agreement with other global estimates of 156 PgC for the
	same period. The biogeophysical impacts of the transient land cover
	change parameters were cooling of the near-surface atmosphere over
	land by -0.1 degrees C, through increased surface albedo and reduced
	shortwave radiation absorption. When combined with other transient
	climate forcings, the higher albedo from land cover change was counteracted
	by decreasing snow albedo from black carbon deposition and high-latitude
	warming. The future CCSM4 RCP simulations showed that the CLM4 transient
	PFT parameters can be used to represent a wide range of land cover
	change scenarios. In the reforestation scenario of RCP 4.5, CCSM4
	simulated a drawdown of 67.3 PgC from the atmosphere into the terrestrial
	ecosystem and product pools. By contrast the RCP 8.5 scenario with
	deforestation and high wood harvest resulted in the release of 30.3

	To help understand to what extent the climate could be affected,

	climate responses to the land cover changes depending on the region.
	The northern part of the basin, where forests and savanna were replaced
	by crops, experiences an overall increase in albedo that leads to
	a reduction of sensible heat flux and near-surface temperature. A
	reduction of surface roughness length leads to stronger low-level
	winds that, in turn, favor a larger amount of moisture being advected

	of the vertically integrated moisture flux convergence (VIMFC) and,
	consequently, in precipitation. In the southern part of the basin,
	changes from grasslands to crops reduce the albedo and thus increase

	We conducted experiments using the Regional Atmosphere modeling system
	(RAMS 4.3), coupled with and without explicit urban energy balance
	model-town energy budget (TEB) to study the role of urban land -
	atmosphere interactions in modulating the heavy rain event over the

	energy balance on surface thermodynamic, boundary layer, and circulation
	changes are analyzed. The results indicate that even for this synoptically
	active rainfall event, the vertical wind and precipitation are significantly
	influenced by heterogeneity in surface temperatures due to urbanization,
	and the effect is more significant during the storm initiation. Interestingly,
	precipitation in the upwind region of Mumbai city is increased in
	the simulation, possibly as a feedback from the sea breeze - urban
	landscape convergence. We find that even with the active monsoon,
	the representation of urbanization contributes to local heavy precipitation
	and mesoscale precipitation distribution over the Indian monsoon
	region. Additional experiments within a statistical dynamical framework
	show that an urban model by itself is not the dominant factor for
	the enhanced rainfall for a Mumbai heavy rain event; the combination
	of updated SST fields using Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission
	(TRMM) data with the detailed representation of urban effects simulated
	by the TEB model created realistic gradients that successfully maintained
	the convergence zone over Mumbai. Further research will require more
	detailed morphology data for simulating weather events in such urban
	regions. The results suggest that urbanization can significantly
	contribute to extremes in monsoonal rain events that have been reported
	to be on the rise.},

	greatly compared to Lai of the trees. The savanna lost 99 g C m−2
	over the period July 2001-March 2004 due to the failure of the 2002-2003
	wet season when rainfall was in the lowest 20th percentile. Net uptake
	of carbon at Tumbarumba was 2510 g C m−2 from February 2001 to March
	2004, with annual productivity ranging from 1060 g C m−2 year−1 in
	a normal year to 360 g C m−2 year−1 during the 2002-2003 drought
	which affected all of eastern Australia. Annual rainfall at the savanna

	annual transpiration above rainfall during the drought of 2002-2003.
	Measurements of Lai and gross primary production (PG) at the two

	At Tumbarumba, MOD17 gave excellent estimates of the annual amplitude

	MOD17 overestimated PG at Virginia Park during the dry season and
	the low-rainfall summer of 2002-2003 but gave satisfactory results
	during the other two wet seasons. Most of the variance in PG at both

	and precipitation is assessed using remote sensing observations of
	monthly fraction of photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) for
	1982 to 2000 with a 2.5 degrees grid resolution. Lead/lag correlations
	are used to infer vegetation-climate interactions. Furthermore, a
	statistical method is used to quantify the efficiency of vegetation
	feedback oil climate in the observations. This feedback analysis
	provides a first quantitative assessment of Global vegetation feedback
	oil climate. In northern mid- and high latitudes, vegetation variabilitv
	is found to be driven predominantly by temperature, in the meantime,
	vegetation also exerts a strong positive feedback on temperature
	with the feedback accounting for over 10%-25% of the total monthly
	temperature variance. The strongest positive feedback occurs in the
	boreal regions of southern Canada/northern United States, northern
	Europe, and southern Siberia, where the feedback efficiency exceeds
	1 degrees C (0.1 FPAR)(-1). Over most of the Tropics and subtropics
	(outside the equatorial rain belt), vegetation is driven primarily
	by precipitation. However, little vegetation feedback is found on
	local precipitation when averaged year-round with the feedback explained
	variance usually accounting for less than 5% of the total precipitation
	variance. Nevertheless, in a few isolated small regions such as Northeast
	Brazil, East Africa. East Asia, and northern Australia, there appears
	to be sonic positive vegetation feedback on local precipitation,
	with the feedback efficiency over 1 cm month(-1) (0.1 FPAR)(-1).
	Further studies suggest a significant seasonal variation of the vegetation
	feedback in sonic regions. A preliminary analysis also seems to suggest
	an enhanced intensity of the vegetation feedback, especially oil
	precipitation, at longer time scales and over a larger grid box area.
	Limitations and implications of the assessment of vegetation feedback
	are also discussed. The assessed vegetation feedback is shown to
	be valuable for the evaluation of vegetation-climate feedback in
	coupled climate-vegetation models.},

  abstract = {Several studies have established that soil moisture increases after
	adding a groundwater component in land surface models, owing to the
	additional supply of subsurface water. However, the impact of groundwater
	on the spatial-temporal variability of precipitation has received
	little attention. This study explores how a groundwater representation
	in land surface models alters precipitation distributions through
	coupled groundwater-land-atmosphere simulations. Results indicate
	that the addition of groundwater yields a global increase in soil
	water content and evapotranspiration, a decrease in surface air temperature,
	and an increase in cloud cover fraction. These result in globally
	inhomogeneous changes in precipitation. In the boreal summer, tropical
	land regions show a positive anomaly in the Northern Hemisphere and
	a negative anomaly in the Southern Hemisphere. As a result, an asymmetric
	dipole is found over tropical land regions along the equator. Furthermore,
	in the transition climatic zone where the land and atmosphere are
	strongly coupled, precipitation also increases. Two main mechanisms
	are suggested for the two different regions with increased precipitation.
	The "rich-get-richer" mechanism is responsible for the positive precipitation
	anomalies over the tropical land regions, while a positive feedback
	of land-atmosphere interaction is the major contributor to increased
	precipitation over central North America. This study highlights the
	importance of land subsurface hydrologic processes in the climate

	performance. The reasons for sensitivity and higher success are investigated
	based on comparisons between observational datasets and simulations
	by the AGCM coupled to either a simple land scheme that specifies
	soil moisture availability or to the Simplified Simple Biosphere
	Model (SSiB) that allows for consideration of soil and vegetation

	The most notable simulation improvements are along the lee of the
	Andes in the lower troposphere, where poleward flow transports abundant
	moisture from the Amazon basin to high latitudes, and in the monsoon
	region where the intensity and pattern of precipitation and upper
	level ice water content are more realistic. It is argued that a better
	depiction of the Chaco Low, which is controlled by local effects

	model performance with low-level flows in central South America.
	The better representation of the atmospheric column static stability
	and large-scale moisture convergence in tropical South America contribute
	to more realistic precipitation over the monsoon region. The overall

	devised to define effective land surface properties. Specific improvements
	for climate purposes are introduced: spatial variability of convective

	percolation. The methodology used to derive climatological maps of
	land surface parameters at the grid-scale resolution of the model
	from existing databases for soil and vegetation types at global scale
	is described. A 3-yr integration for the present day climate with
	a T42L30 version of the climate model has been performed. Results
	obtained compare favorably with available observed climatologies
	related to the various components of the continental surface energy
	and water budgets. Differences are due mostly to a poor simulation
	of the precipitation field. However, some differences suggest specific
	improvements in the surface scheme concerning representation of the
	bare soil albedo, the surface runoff, and the soil moisture initialization.
	As a first step prior to tropical deforestation experiments presented

	kilometers; precipitation decreases exponentially with distance from
	the ocean. 2. In contrast, precipitation over extensive natural forests
	does not depend on the distance from the ocean along several thousand
	kilometers, as illustrated for the Amazon and Yenisey river basins
	and Equatorial Africa. This points to the existence of an active
	biotic pump transporting atmospheric moisture inland from the ocean.
	3. Physical principles of the biotic moisture pump are investigated
	based on the previously unstudied properties of atmospheric water
	vapor, which can be either in or out of acrostatic equilibrium depending
	on the lapse rate of air temperature. A novel physical principle
	is formulated according to which the low-level air moves from areas
	with weak evaporation to areas with more intensive evaporation. Due
	to the high leaf area index, natural forests maintain high evaporation
	fluxes, which support the ascending air motion over the forest and
	"suck in" moist air from the ocean, which is the essence of the biotic
	pump of atmospheric moisture. In the result, the gravitational runoff
	water losses from the optimally moistened forest soil can be fully
	compensated by the biotically enhanced precipitation at any distance
	from the ocean. 4. It is discussed how a continent-scale biotic water
	pump mechanism could be produced by natural selection acting on individual
	trees. 5. Replacement of the natural forest cover by a low leaf index
	vegetation leads to an up to tenfold reduction in the mean continental
	precipitation and runoff, in contrast to the previously available
	estimates made without accounting for the biotic moisture pump. The
	analyzed body of evidence testifies that the long-term stability
	of an intense terrestrial water cycle is unachievable without the
	recovery of natural, self-sustaining forests on continent-wide areas.},

	on land is critically important in the current situation of rapid

	(1) Theoretical consideration of the water cycle on land reveals
	the importance of correct identification of independent and dependent
	terms in the water budget with respect to changing vegetation cover
	for understanding possible scenarios of water cycle change under
	anthropogenic impact. An important controlling influence of the vegetation
	cover is imposed on the outgoing fluxes of atmospheric moisture A(-)
	from land to the ocean, which is maximized in deserts and minimized
	in forested areas, while the dependencies for runoff and precipitation
	are the reverse. (2) Physical mechanisms allowing for efficient water
	retention and minimization of A(-) in forest ecosystems are investigated.
	Atmospheric water vapor is in aerostatic equilibrium when the temperature
	lapse rate is less than G = 1.9 K km(-1) and out of aerostatic equilibrium
	when G > 1.9 K km(-1). In the former case there are no vertical upward
	fluxes of the evaporated water. It is shown that the temperature
	profiles developed under the closed canopies of natural forests keep
	water vapor in aerostatic equilibrium preventing soil moisture loss
	to A(-), in contrast to the situation in open ecosystems like grasslands.

  abstract = {Tropical monsoon circulations exhibit substantial interannual variability.
	Establishing clear links between this variability and the slowly
	varying boundary forcing (sea surface temperatures, SSTs, and land
	surface conditions) has proved difficult. For example, no clear relationships
	have been found between SST anomalies associated with El Nino/La
	Nina events and monsoon rainfall. Despite much research over the
	past 50 years.. there are still questions regarding how different
	components of the land-atmosphere-ocean system contribute to tropical
	monsoon variability. This study examines the question of land-surface-atmosphere
	interactions in large-scale tropical convection and their role in
	rainfall interannual variability. The analysis method is based on
	a conceptual model of convection energetics applied every day of
	the simulation at the grid points within the region of interest.
	This allows for a distinction between the frequency and the characteristic
	energy and water cycle of these events. With two ensembles of five
	and three experiments in which different land-surface schemes are
	used, the relation between land-surface processes and variation of
	the frequency of convection is studied. It has been found in this
	modeling study that the formulation of land surface schemes may be
	important for both the simulation of mean tropical precipitation
	and its interannual variability by way of the frequency of convective
	events. Linked to this is an increased response of hydrological cycle
	over land to SSTAs. Numerous studies have suggested that large-scale
	factors, such as SST, are the dominant control. However the influence
	of surface processes depends on the areal extent and distance that
	separates the region from the ocean. The fact that differences between
	tropical regions decreases as convection intensifies strengthens
	this hypothesis. The conclusion is that it is inappropriate to separate
	the causes of interannual variability between SSTAs and land-surface
	anomalies to explain precipitation variations as land surface processes
	play a significant mediating role in the relationship between SSTs
	and monsoon strength. However there remains the possibility that
	a substantial portion of variability is due to dynamical processes
	internal to the atmosphere. Determining the relative roles of internal
	and lower boundary forcing processes in producing interannual variations

	tropical deforestation from the resulting reduction in transpiration.

	events; however, in September November, changes in precipitation

  abstract = {In semi-arid ecosystems, evapotranspiration (Et) generally represents
	the greatest flux of water out of an ecosystem and is sensitive to
	changes in vegetation cover. In southern Australia, removal of native,
	deep-rooted perennials to make way for annual crops and pastures
	with shallower roots and less annual transpiration has led to rising,
	saline groundwater. Steps to redress this hydrological imbalance
	require knowledge of the ecohydrology of native systems such as eucalypt
	woodlands, which grow on deeper soils low in the landscape, and,
	unlike annual crops, sustain growth and water use during summer months.
	We assessed the partitioning of Et in a common woodland type in south-western
	Australia (Eucalyptus capillosa subsp. capillosa Brooker and Hopper)
	and the response of tree transpiration (Esap) to both atmospheric
	and soil water conditions. Overall, the total woodland evapotranspiration
	(Etotal) exceeded present-year rainfall (359 mm vs. 265 mm) but was
	equal to average rainfall of the preceding 10 years, suggesting long-term
	balance in water supply and Etotal in this system. The contribution
	of Esap to Etotal was surprisingly small (53 and 22% of Etotal in
	summer and winter, respectively) while woodland floor evapotranspiration
	(Efloor) contributed 38 and 64% during the same periods. Rates of
	Esap increased in response to summer rainfall, due primarily to reduced
	sensitivity in summer to vapour pressure deficit when soil water
	potentials increased. Additionally, night-time tree transpiration
	contributed appreciably to the overall water budget (2-8% of seasonal
	Etotal), being similar in magnitude to interception losses, and therefore
	should be included in water budgets. Partitioning of Etotal in this
	woodland type also demonstrated that trees provide a more stable
	water flux out of the system than Efloor, most likely because they
	access soil water from a large volume of soil.},

	part of West Bank, about 10 Km north-west of Hebron city, during
	2005, 2006 and 2007. Five treatments were implemented; forests planted
	with P. halepensis (F), natural vegetation dominated by S. spinosum
	(W.S), natural vegetation where S. spinosum was removed (W/o.S),
	cultivated land (C), and deforestation (Of). Three types of data
	were estimated in each plot: runoff after each rainfall event, sedimentation
	at the end of the rainy season, and chemical and physical soil properties.
	The obtained results indicate that there are significant and important
	differences in runoff generation and sediment production with respect
	to the different types of vegetative cover. Forest and natural vegetation
	dominated by S. spinosum treatments exhibited the lowest amounts
	of runoff, with averages of 2.02 and 1.08 mm, respectively, in comparison
	to other treatments. The removal of S. spinosum significantly increased
	the total amount of runoff and sedimentation compared to the forest
	and S. spinosum treatments. In addition, runoff significantly increased
	(4.03 mm) for the Df treatment compared to that of the forest site.
	The greatest amount of sedimentation was observed in cultivated land

  abstract = {Summary Rapid land use/-cover change has increasingly transformed
	the hydrological functioning of tropical Andean ecosystems. The hydrological
	response to forest cover change strongly depends on the initial state
	of the ecosystem. Relatively little is known about human-disturbed
	ecosystems where forest plantations have been established on highly
	degraded land. In this paper, we analyze the impact of forest change
	on water and sediment fluxes for a highly degraded Andean catchment.
	Different pathways of land cover change (1963-2007) are observed
	in the Jadan catchment, with deforestation taking place in remote
	uplands and recovery and reforestation in the middle and lower parts
	where agricultural and bare lands are prevalent. Time series analyses
	of streamflow and rainfall data (1979/1982-2005/2007) show significant
	shifts in the distribution of rainfall and flow data. Changes in
	discharge are not resulting from changes in precipitation, as the
	direction of change is opposite. The removal of native forest for
	rangeland or croplands (by −20 km2) is likely to have contributed
	to the increase in total annual water yield, through an increase
	in annual baseflow by 25 mm. The observed changes in peakflow are
	important as the 1st percentile highest flow rates were 54% lower,
	while the 1st percentile rainfall amounts increased by 52%. The observed
	decrease in peakflow cannot be explained by clearcut of native forest,
	but is likely to be related to reforestation of degraded lands as
	well as spontaneous recovery of vegetation on remaining grazing lands.
	Over the same time period, a major decrease in specific sediment
	yields and suspended sediment loads was observed. Although deforestation
	in the upper parts led to increased landslide activity, this change
	is not reflected in an increased sediment yield. Small upland rivers
	are often nearly completely blocked by landslide material, thereby
	reducing their potential to transport sediment. In contrast, the
	reduction in estimated erosion is likely to be caused by the reduction
	of the degraded areas in areal extent as well as to the (partial)
	recovery of the vegetation in these areas.},

	the vicinity of the intended vermin-proof boundary in December 2005

	regional rainfall reduction observed in this region. Observations
	and numerical model analysis show that the formation and development

	that initiates spring and summertime convection, is impacted by land
	cover change and that the cloud fields induced by the WCT would extend
	farther west in the absence of the LCC. The surface convergence patterns
	associated with the wintertime WCT circulation are substantially
	altered by LCC, due to changes in both WCT dynamics and surface aerodynamic
	roughness, leading to a rainfall decrease to the west of the rabbit
	fence. Although this study focuses on only two events, it further
	illustrates that LCC has significant regional impacts in southwest
	Western Australia regardless of large-scale shifts in the climate

  abstract = {The potential role of the impacts of land-cover changes (LCCs) in
	the Australian climate is investigated within the context of increasing
	CO2 concentrations and temperature. Specifically, it is explored
	if possible scenarios for LCC can moderate or amplify CO2-induced
	changes in climate over Australia. The January climate of Australia
	is simulated under three different land-cover-change scenarios using
	a high-resolution regional climate model. The land-cover-change scenarios
	include a steady-state land cover that is equivalent to current land
	cover, a low-reforestation scenario that recovers approximately 25%
	of the trees replaced by grasslands within the last 200 yr, and a
	high-reforestation scenario that recovers at least 75% of the deforested
	regions. The model was driven by boundary conditions taken from transitory
	climate simulations from a general circulation model that included
	two climate scenarios based on two projected scenarios of CO2 concentration
	increase. The results show that reforestation has the potential to
	reduce the projected increase in Australian temperatures in 2050
	and 2100 by as much as 40% and 20%, respectively. This cooling effect,
	however, is highly localized and occurs only in regions of reforestation.
	The results therefore hint that the potential of reforestation to
	moderate the impact of global warming may be significantly limited
	by the spatial scale of reforestation. In terms of deforestation,
	results show that any future land clearing can exacerbate the projected
	warming in certain regions of Australia. Carbon-related variables
	are also analyzed and results show that changes in net CO2 flux may
	be influenced more by soil respiration than by photosynthesis. The

	the sources of climate forcing, including surface effects) and the

	method to surface stations in Argentina for the period 1961 - 2000.
	In contrast to most other land areas, over most of Argentina there
	has been net cooling, not warming ( about -0.04 degrees C/ decade).
	Observations also show a very strong decrease in the diurnal temperature
	range north of 40 degrees S. This is associated with an observed
	strong reduction in the maximum temperature ( -0.12 degrees C/ decade)
	together with a weak warming trend in the minimum temperature ( 0.05
	degrees C/ decade). The OMR trends show a warming contribution to
	the mean temperature (+0.07 degrees C/ decade) and a decrease in
	diurnal temperature range ( -0.08 degrees C/ decade), especially
	strong in the areas where the observed precipitation has increased
	the most and where, as a consequence, there has been an exponential
	increase of soy production in the last decade. The increase in precipitation

	length that affects the surface frictional drag, wind velocities
	and moisture convergence. The impact of large-scale vegetation changes
	on all quantities is restricted to the regions of land cover change.
	The perturbation induced by vegetation change interacts with the
	monsoon system by changing the local intensity of the atmospheric

	the wind velocities. There is little evidence that the vegetation

	a southward extension of the monsoon. We therefore find no evidence

	changes in lake levels in the Australian arid interior. We highlight
	some strengths and weaknesses of our approach and emphasise that
	the limitations implicit in our analytical methods means we cannot
	conclusively demonstrate that biospheric feedbacks can be ignored.
	Substantial additional work is therefore required to finally assess

	would increase plant water usage efficiency while still allowing
	CO2 assimilation at current rates. The associated reduction in transpiration
	rates has the potential of causing significant modifications in climate
	on regional and global scales. This paper describes the effects of
	a uniform doubling of the stomatal resistance parameterization in
	a global climate model (GENESIS). The model includes a land-surface
	transfer scheme (LSX) that accounts for the physical effects of vegetation,
	including stomatal resistance and transpiration, which is described
	in detail in an appendix. The atmospheric general circulation model
	is a heavily modified version of the NCAR Community Climate Model
	version 1 with new treatments of clouds, penetrative convection,
	planetary boundary layer mixing, solar radiation, the diurnal cycle,
	and semi-Lagrangian transport of water vapor. The other surface models
	include multi-layer models of soil, snow and sea ice, and a 50-m
	slab ocean mixed layer. The effects of doubling the stomatal resistance
	parameterization are largest in heavily forested regions: tropical
	South America, and parts of the Northern Hemispheric boreal forests
	in Canada, Russia and Siberia in summer. The primary surface changes
	are a decrease in evapotranspiration, an increase in upward sensible
	heat flux, and a surface-air warming. Secondary effects include shifts
	in the ITCZ which cause large increases in precipitation, soil moisture
	and runoff in western tropical South America, and decreases in these
	quantities in northern subtropical Africa. Noticeable changes in
	relative humidity, cloudiness and meridional circulation occur throughout
	the troposphere. The global effects on atmospheric temperature and
	specific humidity are small fractions of those found in other doubled
	CO2 experiments. However, unlike doubled CO2 the signs of those changes
	combine to give relatively large reductions in relative humidity
	and cloudiness. IL is suggested that the stomatal-resistance effect

	climate impact assessment study. The study is performed over the
	French Mediterranean basin using the Safran-Isba-Modcou chain. A
	downscaled A2 regional climate scenario is used to force both versions
	of ISBA, and the results of the two land surface models are compared
	for the present climate and for that at the end of the century. Reasonable
	agreement is found between models and with discharge observations.
	However, ISBA-A-gs has a lower mean evapotranspiration and a higher
	discharge than ISBA-Standard. Results for the impact of climate change
	are coherent on a yearly basis for evapotranspiration, total runoff,
	and discharge. However, the two versions of ISBA present contrasting
	seasonal variations. ISBA-A-gs develops a different vegetation cycle.
	The growth of the vegetation begins earlier and reaches a slightly
	lower maximum than in the present climate. This maximum is followed
	by a rapid decrease in summertime. In consequence, the springtime
	evapotranspiration is significantly increased when compared to ISBA-Standard,
	while the autumn evapotranspiration is lower. On average, discharge
	changes are more significant at the regional scale with ISBA-A-gs.},

	land evaporation variability changes the mean Northern Hemisphere
	storm track and the mean position of the intertropical convergence
	zone, which in turn affect the mean precipitation. The analysis of
	the precipitation variance reveals a general agreement with previous
	works for the midlatitudes, whereas in the Tropics a stronger land-induced
	signal is detected. Furthermore, important regional differences in
	the response are found. Specifically, there is a predominant land
	signal over the Amazon region, in contrast to an equivalence between
	the land and ocean forcings over the Congo basin region. Finally,
	the model appears to be slightly more sensitive to seasonal-interannual
	variations of the land forcing than is the one adopted by Koster

	This study compares those survey results with 2009 data from a sample

	respondents rarely mentioned ozone depletion as a cause of global
	warming. They were also far more likely to correctly volunteer energy
	use as a major cause of climate change; many in 2009 also cited natural
	processes and historical climatic cycles as key causes. When asked
	how to address the problem of climate change, while respondents in
	1992 were unable to differentiate between general "good environmental
	practices" and actions specific to addressing climate change, respondents
	in 2009 have begun to appreciate the differences. Despite this, many

	global warming is primarily due to increased concentrations of carbon
	dioxide in the atmosphere, and the single most important source of

	monthly soil temperature and snow water equivalent from several weather
	stations in east Siberia and west Russia. Our study shows that the
	seasonal cycle of soil temperature is reasonably well reproduced

	temperature bias during winter, and the use of HIRHAM4-NCAR-LSM reduces
	such bias because of its more advanced land surface schemes. Insulation
	by snow on the ground surface is one of the main controlling factors
	of soil temperature, and the increased association between snow and
	soil temperature in HIRHAM4-NCAR-LSM has led to the improvement in
	winter soil temperature. We further established that the influences
	of land surface schemes and their coupling on the atmospheric conditions
	not only affect climate simulations on land but also in remote Arctic
	Ocean regions. Similarly as for the present day climate, two different
	land surface schemes can have significant influences on the simulated

	is found from August-October to November-January and the weakest
	evidence is found from March-May to May-July. In some regions and

	has become essential as deforestation of mountain areas proceeds
	at an increased rate worldwide. Passive and active cloud-water collectors,
	throughfall and stemflow collectors, visibility or droplet size measurements,
	and micrometeorological sensors are typically used to measure the
	fog water inputs to ecosystems. In addition, stable isotopes may
	be used as a natural tracer for fog and rain. Previous studies have
	shown that the isotopic signature of fog tends to be more enriched
	in the heavier isotopes 2H and 18O than that of rain, due to differences
	in condensation temperature and history. Differences between fog
	and rain isotopes are largest when rain is from synoptic-scale storms,
	and fog or orographic cloud water is generated locally. Smaller isotopic
	differences have been observed between rain and fog on mountains
	with orographic clouds, but only a few studies have been conducted.
	Quantifying fog deposition using isotope methods is more difficult
	in forests receiving mixed precipitation, because of limitations
	in the ability of sampling equipment to separate fog from rain, and
	because fog and rain may, under some conditions, have similar isotopic
	composition. This article describes the various types of fog most
	relevant to montane cloud forests and the importance of fog water
	deposition in the hydrologic budget. A brief overview of isotope
	hydrology provides the background needed to understand isotope applications
	in cloud forests. A summary of previous work explains isotopic differences
	between rain and fog in different environments, and how monitoring
	the isotopic signature of surface water, soil water and tree xylem
	water can yield estimates of the contribution of fog water to streamflow,
	groundwater recharge and transpiration. Next, instrumentation to
	measure fog and rain, and methods to determine isotopic concentrations
	in plant and soil water are discussed. The article concludes with
	the identification of some of the more pressing research questions
	in this field and offers various suggestions for future research.

	The variation of Gsmax within these boundaries can be explained by
	effects of plant nutrition on stomatal conductance via effects on

	which would result from totally clearing the tropical rain forests
	in Africa. The primary research vehicle in our investigation was
	the standard version of the National Center for Atmospheric Research
	(NCAR) CCM3 global climate model (GCM), with a horizontal resolution
	of triangular spectral truncation T42 (approximately 2.8 degrees
	x 2.8 degrees). Two separate 10 yr simulations were performed; for
	each of these the global climatological sea surface temperature field
	was prescribed. The purpose of the 10 yr simulations was to provide
	a sufficiently large ensemble whose average minimizes model noise
	errors. In the control simulation normal vegetation was prescribed.
	The design of the anomaly experiment was similar to the control run
	except that the tropical rainforest regions in Africa were replaced
	by savanna grassland vegetation. The CCM3 GCM successfully simulated
	the primary features of the seasonal mean climate conditions over
	Africa. The model results show that replacement of tropical rain
	forest vegetation with savanna grassland vegetation produces the
	following climate changes over Africa: (1) Over the deforested region,
	the model results indicate a significant reduction in area-averaged
	rainfall throughout the year. The decrease ranges between 2 to 3
	mm d(-1) during the northern hemispheric summer months, when the
	region experiences the driest conditions (July to September), and
	less than 1 mm d(-1) during the wettest months (autumn and spring).
	(2) Over southern Africa deforestation results in substantial rainfall
	reduction over Mozambique and rainfall increase over Botswana, Zambia,
	the southern region of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and
	parts of South Africa. Changes in the trapped Rossby wave train activity
	generated by the mid-tropospheric latent heating over the tropical
	forest region are responsible for the continental-scale teleconnection
	climate response. (3) Over Eastern and Western Africa the impact
	of deforestation is primarily characterized by a reduction in rainfall,
	however the adopted GCM T42 resolution may not have been adequate
	to resolve the large contrasts in terrain and vegetation types. (4)

  abstract = {Soil moisture is a key variable of the climate system. It constrains
	plant transpiration and photosynthesis in several regions of the
	world, with consequent impacts on the water, energy and biogeochemical
	cycles. Moreover it is a storage component for precipitation and
	radiation anomalies, inducing persistence in the climate system.
	Finally, it is involved in a number of feedbacks at the local, regional
	and global scales, and plays a major role in climate-change projections.
	In this review, we provide a synthesis of past research on the role
	of soil moisture for the climate system, based both on modelling
	and observational studies. We focus on soil moisture-temperature
	and soil moisture-precipitation feedbacks, and their possible modifications
	with climate change. We also highlight further impacts of soil moisture
	on climate, and the state of research regarding the validation of
	the relevant processes. There are promises for major advances in
	this research field in coming years thanks to the development of
	new validation datasets and multi-model initiatives. However, the
	availability of ground observations continues to be critical in limiting
	progress and should therefore strongly be fostered at the international
	level. Exchanges across disciplines will also be essential for bridging
	current knowledge gaps in this field. This is of key importance given
	the manifold impacts of soil moisture on climate, and their relevance
	for climate-change projections. A better understanding and quantification
	of the relevant processes would significantly help to reduce uncertainties

	Climate models consistently predict an increase in the variability

	mechanisms using regional simulations of recent and future climatic
	conditions with and without land - atmosphere interactions. Our results
	indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted

	the land surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, they suggest that
	land - atmosphere interactions increase climate variability in this
	region because climatic regimes in Europe shift northwards in response
	to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional
	climate zone with strong land - atmosphere coupling in central and
	eastern Europe. These findings emphasize the importance of soil-
	moisture - temperature feedbacks ( in addition to soil- moisture
	- precipitation feedbacks(7-10)) in influencing summer climate variability

	both from conventional understandings of scientific representation
	and the use of knowledge, so acquired, in decision-making. We argue,
	however, that both of these particular understandings are contestable.
	In addition to questioning their current policy-usefulness, we draw
	upon existing analyses of GCMs which discuss model trade-offs, errors,
	and the effects of parameterisations, to raise questions about the
	validity of the conception of complexity in conventional accounts.
	An alternative approach to modelling, incorporating concepts of uncertainty,

	have come to occupy their dominant position, we argue that the development
	of global climate change science and global environmental ‘management’
	frameworks occurs concurrently and in a mutually supportive fashion,
	so uniting GCMs and environmental policy developments in certain
	industrialised nations and international organisations. The more
	basic questions about what kinds of commitments to theories of knowledge
	underpin different models of ‘complexity’ as a normative principle

	that a composite index, capturing SST variations in the Indian Ocean,

	more useful in studying interannual variability. We also find that,
	while most indices can be significantly linked to rainfall fluctuations
	on interannual time scales, these links do not adequately describe
	the long-term trends. This suggests that the drivers of long-term
	trends in southern Australian rainfall do not involve the tropical
	oceans so much as changes in the large-scale atmospheric circulation.},

  abstract = {Numerous studies have identified the regional-scale climate response
	to tropical deforestation through changes to water, energy, and momentum
	fluxes between the land surface and the atmosphere. There has been
	little research, however, on the role of tropical deforestation on
	the global climate. Previous studies have focused on the climate
	response in the extratropics with little analysis of the mechanisms
	responsible for propagating the signal out of the tropics. A climate
	modeling study is presented of the physical processes that are important
	in transmitting a deforestation signal out of the tropics to the
	Northern Hemisphere extratropics in boreal winter. Using the Community
	Climate System Model, version 3 Integrated Biosphere Simulator (CCM3-IBIS)
	climate model and by imposing an exaggerated land surface forcing
	of complete tropical forest removal, the thermodynamic and dynamical
	atmospheric response is evaluated regionally within the tropics,
	globally as the climate signal propagates to the Northern Hemisphere,
	and then regionally in Eurasia where land-atmosphere feedbacks contribute
	to amplifying the climate signal and warming the surface and lower
	troposphere by 1-4 K. Model results indicate that removal of the
	tropical forests causes weakening of deep tropical convection that
	excites a Rossby wave train emanating northeastward away from the
	South American continent. Changes in European storm-track activity
	cause an intensification and northward shift in the Ferrel cell that
	leads to anomalous adiabatic warming over a broad region of Eurasia.
	Regional-scale land-atmosphere feedbacks are found to amplify the
	warming. While hypothetical, this approach illustrates the atmospheric
	mechanisms linking the tropics with Eurasia that may otherwise not
	be detectable with more realistic land-use change simulations.},

	that â€˜it is likely that there has been significant anthropogenic
	warming over the past 50 years averaged over each continent except

	attributed to human influence, and further evidence has accumulated
	attributing a much wider range of climate changes to human activities.
	Such changes are broadly consistent with theoretical understanding,

	This paper reviews this evidence from a regional perspective to reflect
	a growing interest in understanding the regional effects of climate

	SCM employed Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS-2) GCM physics,
	which includes a recent version of prognostic cloud scheme (Microphysics
	of Clouds with Relaxed Arakawa-Schubert), and a land model (Simplified
	Simple Biosphere Model) coupled to a highly resolved soil hydrological
	description in the vertical. The four ARM-CART datasets employed
	in these studies are referred as case 1, case 3, case 4, and case
	8. The SCM simulation results broadly confirm the previous findings
	that an increase in the solar absorption and surface evaporation
	helps to increase the local rainfall, but they also reveal that the
	magnitude of the rainfall increase is strongly affected by the ability
	of the background circulation to promote moist convection. The simulated
	precipitation increase was as large as 50% of the evapotranspiration
	increase for case 1 that covered a relatively wet period. It was
	substantially reduced for cases 3 and 4 covering a normal rainfall
	period and became negligible for case 8, a dry case. A part of evaporation
	increase became horizontal divergence of water vapor; this would
	have the potential of increasing the precipitation downstream of
	the test region. For a particular background circulation, it was
	found that the evaporation-precipitation relationship, often defined
	as recycling ratio, is remarkably robust even for a large range of
	vegetation covers, soil types, and initial soil moistures. Notwithstanding
	the limitations of only one-way interaction (i.e., the large scale
	influencing the regional physics and not vice versa), the current
	SCM simulations show that recycling ratio is a function of the background
	circulation and not a regional and/or seasonal feature. Indeed, a
	vigorous biosphere can help to produce more rainfall under wet conditions
	but may do little to dislodge a large-scale drought. It is pointed
	out that even though these inferences are robust, they are prone
	to weaknesses of the SCM physics as well as the assumption of the
	large scale remaining unaffected by changes of moist processes.},

  abstract = {Two sets of 5-year long integrations were performed with the GLA GCM
	with a simple biosphere model (SiB) to delineate the influence of
	Amazonian deforestation on the local as well as basinwide circulation
	and rainfall. The control case invoked a normally forested Amazonia,
	while the deforestation case distinguished the partially deforested
	Amazonia (until the year 1988) as savanna. Except for this one difference,
	all other initial and the prescribed boundary conditions were identical
	in both integrations. A differential analysis of these two simulations
	revealed the following. (1) There was a large decrease in evapotranspiration
	(1.15 mm d(-1), roughly 33%) in the deforested region, while the
	basinwide decrease was only 0.24 mm d(-1) (roughly 8%). (2) The associated
	decrease of precipitation in the deforested (basinwide) regions was
	about 0.30 (0.168) mm d(-1). A precipitation decrease that is smaller
	than evapotranspiration decrease reflects a mitigating influence
	of increased moisture convergence, particularly within the boundary
	layer that gets warmed by the increased surface fluxes of sensible
	heat and longwave radiation. This implies that precipitation decrease
	in response to the 1988-level of Amazonian deforestation could be
	reversed, i.e., reforestation is likely to emerge if the anthropogenic
	pressures were eliminated and deforestation were forestalled. (3)
	The changes in the surface wind and rainfall patterns together with
	increased runoff and surface temperature indicate potential hydrological
	as well as ecological consequences of deforestation. In our simulations,
	only small regions of the Amazon basin produced precipitation and
	circulation changes at 90% or better statistical significance level.
	This is a consequence of a more realistic deforestation in Amazonia
	as compared to the total deforestation scenario used in previous

	located in a humid subtropical mountainous region in southern China.
	We analyzed 27 years (i.e., 1967-1993) of streamflow and climate
	data and associated vegetation cover change in the watershed. Land
	use /land cover census and Normalized Difference of Vegetation Index
	(NDVI) data derived from remote sensing were used to construct historic

	annual streamflow (Q) and runoff /precipitation ratio did not change
	significantly, nor did the climatic variables, including air temperature,
	Hamon's potential evapotranspiration (ET), pan evaporation, sunshine
	hours, and radiation. However, annual ET estimated as the differences
	between P and Q showed a statistically significant increasing trend.
	Overall, the NDVI of the watershed had a significant increasing trend
	in the peak spring growing season. This study concluded that watershed
	ecosystem ET increased as the vegetation cover shifted from low stock
	forests to shrub and grasslands that had higher ET rates. A conceptual
	model was developed for the study watershed to describe the vegetation
	cover-streamflow relationships during a 50-year time frame. This

  abstract = {Climate impacts of land cover change (LCC) are still a subject of
	discussion despite growing evidence that LCC affects global and regional
	climates (Zhao et al. 2001; Timbal and Arblaster 2006; Pielke et
	al. 2002; Narisma and Pitman 2003). To investigate the climate impacts
	of LCC, this paper presents results for two sets of 10 member ensemble
	experiments using CSIRO atmospheric GCM. The CSIRO climate model
	is a fully coupled atmosphere, land surface, sea ice and ocean model,
	with a model horizontal resolution of similar to 1.8 degrees grid
	increment and 18 vertical levels. In this study, we used the uncoupled
	version where ocean and sea ice components were represented by observed
	seasonally varying sea surface temperatures and sea ice data. We
	quantified changes in land surface parameters and impacts on mean
	climate from the pre-European (1788) to modern day (1990) land covers
	and impact of ENSO on the strength of surface temperature anomalies
	during second half of 20(th) century. Pre-clearing land surface parameters
	were generated by extrapolating modern-day values of remnant native
	vegetation to the pre-European extents of each land cover class.
	The extrapolation was performed for Australian continent at 8 km
	spatial resolution and the fine scale parameters then aggregated
	using Shuttleworth's (1991) approach to coarse resolution aggregated
	for model. The largest differences between pre-European and modern
	day surface parameters were in eastern Queensland, southwest Western
	Australia, and New South Wales/Victoria. In eastern Queensland, vegetation
	fraction and leaf area index during the summer decreased by 14% and
	20% respectively. This corresponded to a surface albedo increase
	of 4%. Stomatal resistance increased by 3% and surface roughness
	decreased by 54%. In New South Wales/Victoria, similarly large decreases
	in vegetation fraction (19%) and LAI (23%) caused an albedo increase
	of 7%, while there was a corresponding 46% reduction in surface roughness.
	In southwest Western Australia, replacement of native woodlands with
	predominantly winter grains and crops resulted in a modest decrease
	in vegetation fraction (5%) and LAI (2%) during winter, while stomatal
	resistance decreased by 15%. However, surface albedo increased by
	14% due to higher reflectance of sandy soils. Overall, the largest
	impact of land cover change on land surface parameters occurred in
	eastern Australia. Our results showed that modification of vegetation
	in eastern Queensland and New South Wales/Victoria contributed to
	increases in area-averaged surface temperatures of 0.19 degrees C
	and 0.63 degrees C in the present-day compared to the pre-European
	values. In New South Wales/Victoria, area-averaged total rainfall
	decreased by 2.5%, while in eastern Queensland there was a rainfall
	decrease of 5.2%. The impact of LCC on the winter climate of southwest
	Western Australia was a cooling of 0.14 degrees C, even though albedo
	increased. This coincided with a small increase in winter rainfall
	by 0.6% and soil moisture by about 12%. Our winter response of increased
	rainfall is at odds with Pitman et al (2004) and Timbal and Arblaster
	(2006) although annual average rainfall, showing a decline of 0.24%,
	is consistent with their results. Nevertheless, even this decline
	is too small to be attributable to the influence of LCC. Further
	studies are needed to address the exact cause of this discrepancy.
	Composites of summer surface temperatures during the five strongest
	El Nino and La Nina episodes from 1950-2003 showed significant warming
	under present-day land cover conditions. However, increases in surface
	temperatures in eastern Australia were the highest during both episodes.
	On average, the strongest warming (approximate to 3.6 degrees C)
	occurred during 1982/1983 El Nino in eastern Australia and southwest
	Western Australia, the regions of largest land cover change. The
	surface temperature were similar for 1997/98 and 2002/2003 El Nino
	years, indicating the land surface forcings act to amplify the effect
	of El Nino on the surface climate of Australia. The findings indicate
	that replacing the native woody vegetation with crops and grazing
	has resulted in significant changes in regional climates, with a
	shift to warmer and drier conditions, especially in eastern Australia,
	the nation's major agricultural production zone.},

  abstract = {A number of general circulation model (GCM) experiments have shown
	that changes in vegetation in the Sahel can cause substantial reductions
	in rainfall. In some studies, the climate sensitivity is large enough
	to trigger drought of the severity observed since the late 1960s.
	The extent and intensity of vegetation changes are crucial in determining
	the magnitude of the atmospheric response in the models. However,
	there is no accurate historical record of regional vegetation changes
	extending back to before the drought began. One important driver
	of vegetation change is land use practice. In this paper the hypothesis
	that recent changes in land use have been large enough to cause the
	observed drought is tested. Results from a detailed land use model
	are used to generate realistic maps of vegetation changes linked
	to land use. The land use model suggests that cropland coverage in
	the Sahel has risen from 5% to 14% in the 35 yr prior to 1996. It
	is estimated that this process of agricultural extensification, coupled
	with deforestation and other land use changes, translates to a conversion
	of 4% of the land from tree cover to bare soil over this period.
	The model predicts further changes in the composition of the land
	surface by 2015 based on changes in human population (rural and urban),
	livestock population, rainfall, cereals imports, and farming systems.
	The impact of land use change on Sahelian climate is assessed using
	a GCM, forced by the estimates of land use in 1961, 1996, and 2015.
	Relative to 1961 conditions, simulated rainfall decreases by 4.6%
	(1996) and 8.7% (2015). The decreases are closely linked to a later
	onset of the wet season core during July. Once the wet season is
	well developed, however, the sensitivity of total rainfall to the
	land surface is greatly reduced, and depends on the sensitivity of
	synoptic disturbances to the land surface. The results suggest that
	while the climate of the region is rather sensitive to small changes
	in albedo and leaf area index, recent historical land use changes
	are not large enough to have been the principal cause of the Sahel
	drought. However, the climatic impacts of land use change in the
	region are likely to increase rapidly in the coming years.},

	New dynamically based mesoscale time- and space-scale boundaries

	In the proposed flow-class classification, the starting point is
	the complete (no approximations) set of mesoscale equations for non-Boussinesq
	flows. In the subsequent scale analysis. the deep and shallow Boussinesq
	flow divisions of Dutton and Fichtl are kept, as is the shallow-flow
	subdivisions of Mahrt In addition, the scale analysis approach of
	Mahrt is extended to deep Boussinesq motions. Limits of applicability
	of each derived flow-class equation set (with respect to atmospheric
	phenomena that can be simulated) are also discussed. The proposed
	hierarchy of atmospheric motions is organized into hydrostatic versus
	nonhydrostatic flow types and then into non-Boussinesq, deep, and
	shallow Boussinesq motions. Criteria used to differentiate each resulting
	flow class are discussed, while resulting governing thermodynamic

	limits of each Boussinesq mesoscale flow subclass are constructed
	from order of magnitude estimates for the various length and flow-class
	separation criteria. A summary of the consensus in the literature

  abstract = {An approximate formulation of how much moisture that precipitates
	out comes from local evaporation versus horizontal transport, referred
	to as "recycling," has allowed new estimates of recycling, to be
	mapped globally as a function of length scale. The recycling is formulated
	in terms of the "intensity of the hydrological cycle" I, which is
	alternatively referred to as a "precipitation efficiency" as it denotes
	the fraction of moisture flowing through a region that is precipitated
	out, and a "moistening efficiency," M, which is defined as the fraction
	of moisture evaporated from a region to that flowing through. While
	datasets of the pertinent quantities have improved, they still contain
	uncertainties. Results show that often the intensity is not greatest
	at times of greatest precipitation because moisture transport into
	the region is also a maximum, especially in the monsoonal regions.
	The annual cycle variations of I are fairly small over North America
	and Europe while large seasonal variations in M occur in most places.
	Seasonal mean maps of precipitation, evaporation (E), and atmospheric
	moisture transport are presented and discussed along with the seasonal
	and annual means of derived precipitation and moisture efficiencies
	and the recycling Fraction. The recycling results depend greatly
	on the scale of the domain under consideration and global maps of
	the recycling for seasonal and annual means are produced for 500-
	and 1000-km scales that therefore allow the heterogeneity of the
	fields across river basins to be captured. Global annual mean recycling
	for 500-km scales is 9.6%, consisting of 8.9% over land and 9.9%
	over the oceans. Even for 1000-km scales, less than 20% of the annual
	precipitation typically comes from evaporation within that domain.
	Over the Amazon, strong advection of moisture dominates the supply
	of atmospheric moisture over much of the river basin but local evaporation
	is much more prominent over the southern parts, and, for the annual
	cycle as a whole, about 34% of the moisture is recycled. Over the
	Mississippi Basin, the recycling is about 21%. The smaller number
	mostly reflects the smaller domain size. Relatively high annual values
	of recycling (>20%) occur in the subtropical highs. where E is high
	and the advective moisture flux is small, and in convergence zones
	where, again, the advective moisture flux is small. Low annual values
	occur over the southern oceans, the North Pacific, and the eastern
	equatorial Pacific, where the moisture flux is at a maximum.},

	differ in worldview, ranging from enhanced global cooperation towards

	model was used to downscale these demands to land use patterns at
	1 km2 resolution. The land use model explicitly accounts for the

	The old land surface model incorporates the force-restore method
	for soil temperatures and the bucket approximation for soil moisture;
	the new model, CLASS (Canadian Land Surface Scheme) features three
	soil layers, an explicitly modelled snow layer, a thermally separate
	vegetation canopy, and physically-based calculations of heat and
	moisture transfers between all of the land surface components and
	the atmosphere. It was reported in previous papers that compared
	with observations, the old scheme tends to generate a climate which
	is characterized by anomalously high precipitation rates and cold
	temperatures over land In this paper, by reference to field measurements
	and to the energy fluxes and temperatures generated by the two models
	at local scales, the hypotheses earlier postulated as to the underlying
	reasons for this are validated. The main factor contributing to the
	climate anomalies observed with the old scheme is found to be its
	generation of excessive evaporation rates; this is caused by the
	fact that the evaporation rate is never directly energy-limited the
	fact that the scaling of the evaporation rate with decreasing soil
	moisture content underestimates the effect of vegetation stomatal
	resistance, and the fact that the evaporation rate over bare soil
	depends not on the surface soil moisture, but on the moisture content
	of whole modelled soil column. The cold surface temperatures are
	additionally attributed to systematic errors incurred by the forward-stepping
	temperature scheme, and to the fact that soils subjected to subzero
	temperature forcing in the winter are modelling as freezing completely.
	Finally, the inability of the old scheme to simulate partially frozen
	soils means that it proves unable to handle either shallow frost
	penetration at temperature latitudes, or the development of an active

  abstract = {A new tropical deforestation experiment has been performed, with the
	ARPEGE-Climat atmospheric global circulation model associated with
	the ISBA land surface scheme. Simulations are forced with observed
	monthly mean sea surface temperatures and thus inter-annual variability
	of the ocean system is taken into account. The local mean response
	to deforestation over Amazonia and Africa is relatively weak compared
	with most published studies and compensation effects are particularly
	important. However, a large increase in daily maximum temperatures
	is obtained during the dry season when soil water stress dominates.
	The analysis of daily variability shows that the distributions of
	daily minimum and maximum temperatures are noticeably modified with
	an increase in extreme temperatures. Daily precipitation amounts
	also indicate a weakening of the convective activity. Conditions
	for the onset of convection are less frequently gathered, particularly
	over southern Amazonia and western equatorial Africa. At the same
	time, the intensity of convective events is reduced, especially over
	equatorial deforested regions. The inter-annual variability is also
	enhanced. For instance, El Nino events generally induce a large drying
	over northern Amazonia, which is well reproduced in the control simulation.
	In the deforested experiment, a positive feedback effect leads to
	a strong intensification of this drying and a subsequent increase
	in surface temperature. The change in variability as a response to
	deforestation can be more crucial than the change of the mean climate
	since more intense extremes could be more detrimental for agriculture

	SiB vegetation cover (comprising 12 biomes) and assumed a fully forested
	Amazonia, while the second set, called deforestation cases, distinguished
	the partially deforested regions of Amazonia as savanna. Except for
	this difference, all other initial and prescribed boundary conditions

	analyses of these five cases show the following local effects of
	deforestation. 1) A discernible decrease in evapotranspiration of

	averages and exhibits complex evolution that extends downstream with
	the winds. A larger decrease in precipitation as compared to evapotranspiration
	produces some drying and warming. The precipitation differences are
	consistent with the decrease in atmospheric moisture flux convergence
	and are consistent with earlier simulation studies of local climate
	change due to large-scale deforestation. 3) A significant decrease
	in the surface drag force (as a consequence of reduced surface roughness
	of deforested regions) that, in turn, affects the dynamical structure
	of moisture convergence and circulation. The surface winds increase

  abstract = {The asymptotic predictability of global land surface precipitation
	is estimated empirically at the seasonal time scale with lead times
	from 0 to 12 months. Predictability is defined as the unbiased estimate
	of predictive skill using a given model structure assuming that all
	relevant predictors are included, thus representing an upper bound
	to the predictive skill for seasonal forecasting applications. To
	estimate predictability, a simple linear regression model is formulated
	based on the assumption that land surface precipitation variability
	can be divided into a component forced by low-frequency variability
	in the global sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) field and that
	can theoretically be predicted one or more seasons into the future,
	and a 'weather noise' component that originates from nonlinear dynamical
	instabilities in the atmosphere and is not predictable beyond ~10
	days. Asymptotic predictability of global precipitation was found
	to be 14.7% of total precipitation variance using 1900-2007 data,
	with only minor increases in predictability using shorter and presumably
	less error-prone records. This estimate was derived based on concurrent
	SSTA-precipitation relationships and therefore constitutes the maximum
	skill achievable assuming perfect forecasts of the evolution of the
	SSTA field. Imparting lags on the SSTA-precipitation relationship,
	the 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month predictability of global precipitation
	was estimated to be 7.3%, 5.4%, 4.2%, and 3.7%, respectively, demonstrating
	the comparative gains that can be achieved by developing improved
	SSTA forecasts compared to developing improved SSTA-precipitation
	relationships. Finally, the actual average cross-validated predictive
	skill was found to be 2.1% of the total precipitation variance using
	the full 1900-2007 dataset and was dominated by the El Nino-Southern
	Oscillation (ENSO) phenomenon. This indicates that there is still
	significant potential for increases in predictive skill through improved
	parameter estimates, the use of longer and/or more reliable datasets,
	and the use of larger spatial fields to substitute for limited temporal
	records.},

  abstract = {The conventional approach to evaluating the joint statistical significance
	of multiple hypothesis tests (i.e., "field," or "global," significance)
	in meteorology and climatology is to count the number of individual
	(or "local") tests yielding nominally significant results and then
	to judge the unusualness of this integer value in the context of
	the distribution of such counts that would occur if all local null
	hypotheses were true. The sensitivity (i.e., statistical power) of
	this approach is potentially compromised both by the discrete nature
	of the test statistic and by the fact that the approach ignores the
	confidence with which locally significant tests reject their null
	hypotheses. An alternative global test statistic that has neither
	of these problems is the minimum p value among all of the local tests.
	Evaluation of field significance using the minimum local p value
	as the global test statistic, which is also known as the Walker test,
	has strong connections to the joint evaluation of multiple tests
	in a way that controls the "false discovery rate" (FDR, or the expected
	fraction of local null hypothesis rejections that are incorrect).
	In particular, using the minimum local p value to evaluate field
	significance at a level α^sub global^ is nearly equivalent to the
	slightly more powerful global test based on the FDR criterion. An
	additional advantage shared by Walker's test and the FDR approach
	is that both are robust to spatial dependence within the field of
	tests. The FDR method not only provides a more broadly applicable
	and generally more powerful field significance test than the conventional
	counting procedure but also allows better identification of locations
	with significant differences, because fewer than α^sub global^ ×
	100% (on average) of apparently significant local tests will have
	resulted from local null hypotheses that are true. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

  abstract = {In a changing climate, changes in rainfall variability and, in particular,
	extreme rainfall events are likely to be highly significant for environmentally
	vulnerable regions such as southern Africa. It is generally accepted
	that sea-surface temperatures play an important role in modulating
	rainfall variability, thus the majority work to date has focused
	on these mechanisms. However past research suggests that land surface
	processes are also critical for rainfall variability. In particular,
	work has suggested that the atmosphere-land surface feedback has
	been important for past abrupt climate changes, such as those which
	occurred over the Sahara during the mid-Holocene or, more recently,
	the prolonged Sahelian drought. Therefore the primary aim of this
	work is to undertake idealised experiments using both a regional
	and global climate model, to test the sensitivity of rainfall variability
	to land surface changes over a location where such abrupt climate
	changes are projected to occur in the future, namely southern Africa.
	In one experiment, the desert conditions currently observed over
	southwestern Africa were extended to cover the entire subcontinent.
	This is based on past research which suggests a remobilisation of
	sand dune activity and spatial extent under various scenarios of
	future anthropogenic global warming. In the second experiment, savanna
	conditions were imposed over all of southern Africa, representing
	an increase in vegetation for most areas except the equatorial regions.
	The results suggest that a decrease in rainfall occurs in the desert
	run, up to 27% of total rainfall in the regional model (relative
	to the control), due to a reduction in available moisture, less evaporation,
	less vertical uplift and therefore higher near surface pressure.
	This result is consistent across both the regional and global model
	experiments. Conversely an increase in rainfall occurs in the savanna
	run, because of an increase in available moisture giving an increase
	in latent heat and therefore surface temperature, increasing vertical
	uplift and lowering near surface pressure. These experiments, however,
	are only preliminary, and form the first stage of a wider study into
	how the atmosphere-land surface feedback influences rainfall extremes
	over southern Africa in the past (when surface i.e. vegetation conditions
	were very different) and in the future under various scenarios of
	future climate change. Future work will examine how other climate
	models simulate the atmosphere-land surface feedback, using more
	realistic vegetation types based on past and future surface conditions.},

	across 22 sites and 50 site-years in FLUXNET, a network of eddy covariance
	sites measuring long-term carbon and energy fluxes in contrasting
	ecosystems and climates. Energy balance closure was evaluated by
	statistical regression of turbulent energy fluxes (sensible and latent
	heat (LE)) against available energy (net radiation, less the energy
	stored) and by solving for the energy balance ratio, the ratio of
	turbulent energy fluxes to available energy. These methods indicate
	a general lack of closure at most sites, with a mean imbalance in
	the order of 20%. The imbalance was prevalent in all measured vegetation
	types and in climates ranging from Mediterranean to temperate and
	arctic. There were no clear differences between sites using open
	and closed path infrared gas analyzers. At a majority of sites closure
	improved with turbulent intensity (friction velocity), but lack of
	total closure was still prevalent under most conditions. The imbalance
	was greatest during nocturnal periods. The results suggest that estimates
	of the scalar turbulent fluxes of sensible and LE are underestimated
	and/or that available energy is overestimated. The implications on
	interpreting long-term CO2 fluxes at FLUXNET sites depends on whether
	the imbalance results primarily from general errors associated with
	the eddy covariance technique or from errors in calculating the available
	energy terms. Although it was not entirely possible to critically
	evaluate all the possible sources of the imbalance, circumstantial
	evidence suggested a link between the imbalance and CO2 fluxes. For
	a given value of photosynthetically active radiation, the magnitude
	of CO2 uptake was less when the energy imbalance was greater. Similarly,
	respiration (estimated by nocturnal CO2 release to the atmosphere)
	was significantly less when the energy imbalance was greater.},

  abstract = {Until the early seventies land degradation and desertification were
	not considered a major issue in most Mediterranean regions. Traditional
	agricultural systems were believed to be able to keep those processes
	in check. Thus low priority was assigned to research programmes and
	projects on soil erosion and conservation, preference being given
	to the impact of farm machinery on soil structure and compaction
	along with the role of organic matter in the soil. In the eighties
	and early nineties the agricultural practices introduced in sloping
	land under cultivation in the Mediterranean in previous decades were
	identified as a major contributor to soil degradation. The unprecedented
	efforts to increase crop yields and maximize profit, made possible
	by the technological revolution in agriculture, had triggered in
	the agricultural ecosystem the onset of soil degradation due to hydrological
	phenomena that proved detrimental both to soil fertility and to the
	landscape causing devastating and permanent damage. In addition,
	it was recognized that research activities were too fragmentary to
	be able to cope with the demands of implementing sound soil conservation
	measures. The Mediterranean climate is characterised by hot dry summers
	and mild wet winters. The region frequently suffers from years of
	scant rainfall and many areas are afflicted by severe drought. The
	UK Hadley Centre's global climate model has been run on a monthly
	basis for the Mediterranean countries to predict the percent variation
	in rainfall and temperature with respect to mean monthly values.
	Scenarios developed using the model show that for the wet season
	(October-March), by the year 2050 rainfall could increase in central
	and eastern Spain, northern France, northern Italy and the Alps by
	up to 15%, against a decrease of about 10% to 15% in the southern
	Mediterranean. For the same period, the temperature in the northern
	Mediterranean is predicted to increase by 1.25 degrees to 2.25 degrees
	C, compared to an increase of between 1.5 degrees and 2.5 degrees
	C in the southern Mediterranean. The projections also show that for
	the dry season (April to September), by the year 2050 rainfall is
	likely to decrease over much of the Basin. Decreased precipitation
	is predicted to be accompanied by a rise in temperature of between
	1.5 and 2.75 degrees C in the northern regions and 1.75 degrees and
	3.0 degrees C in the southern Mediterranean. Reduced precipitation
	during the summer has a major impact on irrigation and tourism, which
	both increase the pressure on water supplies during the dry period.
	To combat these problems, the European Community (EC), in collaboration
	with other international organizations, has funded various programmes
	and projects for mitigating drought and assessing and preventing
	land degradation and desertification. In this context, the paper
	describes the main features and characteristics of some of these
	programmes and projects and proposes new approaches to environmental
	policies, in order to: assess, forecast and mitigate adverse impacts
	of drought; better understand soil erosion, land degradation and
	desertification processes; identify preventive, protective and remedial
	measures; address quantity and quality of natural resources in an
	integrated context; support innovation and participatory strategies.
	The importance and role of institutional strengthening, sound financial
	and managerial frameworks, availability of human resources involved,
	research thrust, technology transfer and networking improvement are
	also highlighted.},

	DRY experiments were carried out for the summer, from 6 January for
	60 days. The results of these experiments differ significantly from
	those conducted with bucket-type land-surface parameterization schemes
	in that: (i) WET or DRY anomalies evolve differently in specific
	regions. The geographical distributions of responses are more disorganized,
	possibly because of the inclusion of vegetation, which may enhance
	the regional features and the non-linear treatment of soil moisture
	content and surface wetness. (ii) Magnitude of responses are larger
	because of the greater number of feedback mechanisms. For example,
	when the feedback of soil moisture and surface albedo is allowed,
	the increase of soil moisture leads to an increase of evaporation.
	The increase of soil moisture results in a decrease in albedo which
	in turn leads to an increase of absorbed solar radiation available
	for evaporation. (iii) Time-scales of adjustment are different for
	DRY and WET anomalies. WET anomalies persist much longer, have stronger
	responses and are more organized than DRY anomalies. (iv) The summer
	WET or DRY anomalies have larger responses than the corresponding

  abstract = {Downstream models are often used in order to study regional impacts
	of climate and climate change on the land surface. For this purpose,
	they are usually driven offline (i.e., 1-way) with results from regional
	climate models (RCMs). However, the offline approach does not allow
	for feedbacks between these models. Thereby, the land surface of
	the downstream model is usually completely different to the land
	surface which is used within the RCM. Thus, this study aims at investigating
	the inconsistencies that arise when driving a downstream model offline
	instead of interactively coupled with the RCM, due to different feedbacks
	from the use of different land surface models (LSM). Therefore, two
	physically based LSMs which developed from different disciplinary
	backgrounds are compared in our study: while the NOAH-LSM was developed
	for the use within RCMs, PROMET was originally developed to answer
	hydrological questions on the local to regional scale. Thereby, the
	models use different physical formulations on different spatial scales
	and different parameterizations of the same land surface processes
	that lead to inconsistencies when driving PROMET offline with RCM
	output. Processes that contribute to these inconsistencies are, as
	described in this study, net radiation due to land use related albedo
	and emissivity differences, the redistribution of this net radiation
	over sensible and latent heat, for example, due to different assumptions
	about land use impermeability or soil hydraulic reasons caused by
	different plant and soil parameterizations. As a result, simulated
	evapotranspiration, e.g., shows considerable differences of max.
	280 mm yr(-1). For a full interactive coupling (i.e., 2-way) between
	PROMET and the atmospheric part of the RCM, PROMET returns the land
	surface energy fluxes to the RCM and, thus, provides the lower boundary
	conditions for the RCM subsequently. Accordingly, the RCM responses
	to the replacement of the LSM with overall increased annual mean
	near surface air temperature (+1 K) and less annual precipitation
	(-56 mm) with different spatial and temporal behaviour. Finally,
	feedbacks can set up positive and negative effects on simulated evapotranspiration,
	resulting in a decrease of evapotranspiration South of the Alps a
	moderate increase North of the Alps. The inconsistencies are quantified
	and account for up to 30% from July to Semptember when focused to
	an area around Milan, Italy.},

	Our study investigated the effect of different revegetation types
	on the physicochemical and microbial soil properties in the Loess
	Plateau, with the aim of determining which revegetation type has
	the best capacity for soil recovery. The vegetation types included
	two shrublands ( Caragana korshinskii and Hippophae rhamnoides ),
	two grasslands ( Astragalus adsurgens and Panicum virgatum ), and
	two species from croplands that were abandoned for natural recovery
	( Artemisia capillaries and Heteropappus altaicus ). Among the plants
	studied, H. altaicus and A. capillaries had the highest values of
	soil organic C, total N, total P, available N, available P, moisture
	content, microbial biomass C (MBC), substrate-induced respiration,
	saccharase, urease, catalase, and peroxidase. Soil sampled from the
	A. adsurgens plot had the highest bulk density and microbial biomass

	quotient (basal respiration / MBC). The soil quality index, which
	was obtained based on the available N, metabolic quotient, MBC, urease,
	polyphenol oxidase, and bulk density, shows that the abandoned cropland
	for natural recovery had the highest soil quality, followed by grassland,
	and then shrubland. Vegetation types affect the physicochemical and

	cropland for natural recovery has the best capacity for improving
	soil quality in the Loess Plateau among all studied revegetation

	Extensive model experiments are conducted to explore uncertainties
	in the modelling results caused by land-surface modelling and the
	model intrinsic noise. Results show moderate but statistically significant
	local impacts by LUC, with significantly different surface temperature
	responses in winter and summer due to two regimes dominating surface
	energy balance in the region. In winter, the model shows consistent
	patterns of a reduction of precipitation in its south/southeast region
	and a cooling in large parts of the country. The cooling is primarily
	attributed to the increase in surface albedo while the rainfall reduction
	is associated with circulation change due to reduced surface roughness.
	In summer, it reveals moderate impacts with a 10-20% rainfall reduction
	and above 0.5A degrees C warming in the south/southeast region. The
	warming is largely the results of reductions in surface evaporation
	and rainfall simulated in the model. Spatially averaged results are
	analysed so as to explicitly characterise the model uncertainties.
	Results suggest that the model-simulated impacts of LUC are not significantly
	affected by complexity in its land-surface parameterisation, with
	the scatter between the runs using different surface complexity modes
	similar to that from a set of the model ensemble runs with different
	initial conditions. This is largely due to the fact that fundamental
	processes affected by LUC, including changes in surface albedo and
	roughness length, are similarly represented in these complexity modes,
	while weak land-air coupling in the model may also contribute to
	such results. Further analysis shows that the model LUC signal is
	much larger than its internal noise derived from ensemble runs and
	detailed analysis of responses in the model physics and dynamics
	is to be documented in another manuscript.},

	impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse warming on climate,
	employing a version of NCAR Community Climate Model (CCM1-Oz), is
	presented. The joint impacts of tropical deforestation and greenhouse
	warming are assessed by an experiment in which removal of tropical
	rainforests is imposed into a greenhouse-warmed climate. Results
	show that the joint climate changes over tropical rainforest regions
	comprise large reductions in surface evapotranspiration (by about
	-180 mm yr(-1)) and precipitation (by about -312 mm yr(-1)) over
	the Amazon Basin, along with an increase of surface temperature by
	+3.0 K. Over Southeast Asia, similar but weaker changes are found
	in this study. Precipitation is decreased by -172 mm yr(-1), together
	with the surface warming of 2.1 K. Over tropical Africa, changes
	in regional climate is much weaker and with some different features,
	such as the increase of precipitation by 25 mm yr(-1). Energy budget
	analyses demonstrates that the large increase of surface temperature
	in the joint experiment is not solely produced by the increase of
	CO2 concentration, but is a joint effect of the reduction of surface
	evaporation (due to deforestation) and the increase of downward atmospheric
	longwave radiation (due to the doubling of CO2 concentration). Furthermore,
	impacts of tropical deforestation on the greenhouse-warmed climate
	are estimated by comparing a pair of tropical deforestation simulations.
	It is found that in CCM1-Oz, deforestation has very similar impacts
	on greenhouse-warmed regional climates as on current climates over
	tropical rainforest regions. The extra-tropical climatic response
	to tropical deforestation is identified in both sets of tropical
	deforestation experiments. Statistically significant responses are
	seen in the large-scale atmospheric circulation such as changes in
	the velocity potential and vertically integrated kinetic and potential
	energy fields. Wave propagation patterns are identified in the large-scale
	circulation anomalies, which provides a mechanism for interpreting

  abstract = {Many modem landscapes in the humid tropics appear as a mosaic of primary
	forest, agricultural land and abandoned areas at various stages of
	regrowth. Whereas the hydrological functioning of primary forest
	and agricultural ecosystems is known to some degree, the impact of
	secondary forests on the hydrological cycle has yet to receive the
	same attention; this is particularly true for the effects of forest
	regrowth on soil hydrology. We investigated the effects of land-use
	and land-cover types representative of largely deforested areas of
	the Amazon basin on soil hydrological flowpaths by quantifying infiltrability
	and field-saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ksat) at two depths (12.5
	and 20 cm) under primary forest, recently cleared secondary forest
	(prepasture), teak (Tectona grandis), pasture and secondary forests
	originating from a former banana-cacao plantation (banana) and from
	pasture (capoeira). We further inferred potential changes in the
	hydrological flowpath regime by comparing our results with prevailing
	rainfall intensities. Infiltrability varied (alpha = 0.05) among
	the cover types according to: {forest} > {banana, capoeira, teak}
	> {pasture}, with prepasture overlapping with forest, banana and
	capoeira. Although the infiltrability of pasture is lower by an order
	of magnitude in comparison to the other cover types, this decrease
	does not affect flowpath patterns as infiltrability still exceeds
	even the highest short-term, such as 5 min, rainfall intensities.
	Ksat at the 12.5 cm depth varies as follows: {forest, banana, capoeira}
	> {teak} > {pasture}, with prepasture being undistinguishable from
	the first group. Under teak and pasture, Ksat is lower than prevailing
	rainfall intensities, which implies the possible generation of a
	perched water table at a shallow depth and hence the generation of
	saturation overland flow. The impact of 13 years of cattle grazing
	prior to planting teak is still measurable even after 10 years of
	growth. At the 20 cm depth, the differences in Ksat among the land
	uses are minor compared to prevailing rainfall intensities, i.e.,
	the vertical flow of water is impeded regardless of land use. We
	conclude that there is a considerable memory effect; hence, any assessment
	of the hydrological functioning of secondary forests, quasi-natural
	or man-made, must take into account the kind, intensity and duration
	of land use prior to regrowth. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights

	with Global Soil Wetness Project, Phase 2 Data, outputs and rainfall
	events. The soil moisture distribution during the rainy period between
	October and May is described and is found to be correlated with the
	vegetation dynamics estimated using the NDVI products. Finally, a
	semiempirical model is proposed, based on satellite moisture and
	NDVI products, which allows the NDVI value to be estimated for a
	period of 1 month during the rainy season as a function of the moisture

	abstract = {Using a global climate model, Amazonian deforestation experiments are conducted perturbing 1, 9, 25, 81 and 121 grid points, each with 5 ensemble members. All experiments show warming and drying over Amazonia. The impact of deforestation on temperature, averaged either over the affected area or a wider area, decreases by a factor of two as the scale of the perturbation increases from 1 to 121 grid points. This is associated with changes in the surface energy balance and consequential impacts on the atmosphere above the regions deforested. For precipitation, as the scale of deforestation increases from 9 to 121 grid points, the reduction in rainfall over the perturbed area decreases from ∼1.5 to ∼1 mm d −1 . However, if the surrounding area is considered and large deforestation perturbations made, compensatory increases in precipitation occur such that there is little net change. This is largely associated with changes in horizontal advection of moisture. Disagreements between climate model experiments on how Amazonian deforestation affects precipitation and temperature are, at least in part, due to the spatial scale of the region deforested, differences in the areas used to calculate averages and whether areas surrounding deforestation are included in the overall averages.},

	abstract = {Precipitation in austral autumn and winter has declined over parts of southern and especially southwestern Australia in the past few decades. According to observations and climate models, at least part of this decline is associated with changes in large-scale atmospheric circulation, including a poleward movement of the westerly winds and increasing atmospheric surface pressure over parts of southern Australia. Here we use a high-resolution global climate model to analyse the causes of this rainfall decline. In our simulations, many aspects of the observed regional rainfall decline over southern and southwest Australia are reproduced in response to anthropogenic changes in levels of greenhouse gases and ozone in the atmosphere, whereas anthropogenic aerosols do not contribute to the simulated precipitation decline. Simulations of future climate with this model suggest amplified winter drying over most parts of southern Australia in the coming decades in response to a high-end scenario of changes in radiative forcing. The drying is most pronounced over southwest Australia, with total reductions in austral autumn and winter precipitation of approximately 40\% by the late twenty-first century.},

	abstract = {The Australian decade-long “Millennium Drought” broke in the summer of 2010/11 and was considered the most severe drought since instrumental records began in the 1900s. A crucial question is whether climate change played a role in inducing the rainfall deficit. The climate modes in question include the Indian Ocean dipole (IOD), affecting southern Australia in winter and spring; the southern annular mode (SAM) with an opposing influence on southern Australia in winter to that in spring; and El Niño-Southern Oscillation, affecting northern and eastern Australia in most seasons and southeastern Australia in spring through its coherence with the IOD. Furthermore, the poleward edge of the Southern Hemisphere Hadley cell, which indicates the position of the subtropical dry zone, has possible implications for recent rainfall declines in autumn. Using observations and simulations from phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), it is shown that the drought over southwest Western Australia is partly attributable to a long-term upward SAM trend, which contributed to half of the winter rainfall reduction in this region. For southeast Australia, models simulate weak trends in the pertinent climate modes. In particular, they severely underestimate the observed poleward expansion of the subtropical dry zone and associated impacts. Thus, although climate models generally suggest that Australia’s Millennium Drought was mostly due to multidecadal variability, some late-twentieth-century changes in climate modes that influence regional rainfall are partially attributable to anthropogenic greenhouse warming.},
